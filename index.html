So a man is whoever exhibits the characteristics deemed worthy. And such worth, from the core of it, is born from our relations with nature; in that she pressures us, and thus asks us to be a certain way. ‚ÄúSurely the character which we remark as good, is one which yieldssuccess.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;The question though, is in terms of the progress of virtue, and how the ‚Äòpleas‚Äô of nature become further known; or there are new ones. For it is easy to ascribe one‚Äôs property within a function as the mark of virtue; the classic example being the purpose of a saw, in its actions at least, and how being sharp was a measure of that. But in that case, what if we were cutting different material, and different qualities of the saw were sought ‚Äîin durability for example. The framework of virtue stays, but the statement of fact, or inspiration for the measure ‚Äîthe draw for virtue- changes, and thus which virtues are indemand.
<br>&emsp;I say this, because like all animals, Man‚Äôs earliest ventures were one of heat, water and food. Transitioning from there to the needs of governance is a tricky task, as the process of technology and the means of using it is not easy to say. For we need at this point some marker of discovery, or principle which explains man‚Äôs acquisition of further functions. Better yet, an understanding of the world in terms of her opportunities, along with pressures placed by her which we did not know. That a volcano was a threat is perhaps something for an animal who is cultured and prone to tales; while God and salvation is a mere extension ofthat.
<br>&emsp;Indeed our own inquiry needs more exactness in order for its general use to be proper. But we might say, from this point, that man has a function via the request of nature; which we might say is motivated by man‚Äôs needs, of which nature advertises a remedy. ‚ÄúThe very fact that water may be in an unknown area, portrays the difficulty nature imposes -in the sense of lands and distance. But so does someones ability to navigate, and in tangent with that acquire direction (via smell in this case), reflect an possession of virtue: literally, by virtue of their ability to succeed. ‚ÄúA challenge sets, and those with virtue are relevantlyeffective.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;Perhaps we could give some duration to what‚Äôs being said, and consider the difference between animals and men, in that one has not quite ever succeeded, while the other reached some point of success: and from there, furthered.
<br>&emsp;Indeed it is a matter of mechanics and definitions to properly state the developments of such success ‚Äîas evident, via archeology for instance, and in principle, as in the general progress through various forms of tech and culture. Right now, our general principle is one of virtue and nature, and Man‚Äôs evident success as the one asked by the latter  to exhibit the former ‚Äîi.e, effective traits. But as mentioned, the actual steps this partake, needs more exact principles as to generally speak of man in more detail. Broadly speaking, he initially succeeded and went from there. But of what initially point and why, and through each subsequent point, doth the depth of inquirylay.
<br>&emsp;I will not speak of such things specifically. But I will orient this baser depiction. That is, considering man‚Äôs early successes, as homo even, the common property of such success is that it was pre-ancient. I admit this is a blank term; but I say it if only to preface what I will now explain. Pre-ancient means that advancements are not cultural, but techonocligal. This itself may not fully demonstrate what pre-society is, but so can we contrast the two with the assessment of our place amidst nature, and whether we are simply maintaining the necessities that we already have (in method and extraction), or if we are simply improving at getting by. For animals never succeed, as they at best survive in order to procreate, then die. Their always in struggle though. At least, they never have any means but to try, and hopefully succeed. And man may indeed have been like that. But so much as he was, was he an animal; while his developments which gave him more ‚Äòconcreteness‚Äô amidst those troubles of nature, makes him less so.
<br>&emsp;At this point however, comes the need to describe the transition between technology and culture. For one is made through excess, while the other is at best sufficient. If you imagine wild animals, their quest for food is always perpetual, in that they only have what they achieved that day, and have no definite means of succeeding again. Technology is man‚Äôs advent in order to revert that, whereby they acquire more than a mere instance of resources; or they have reliable means to get it again. By that, man became steady, or increasingly at least.  And from that, inch by inch, society lay.
<br>&emsp;The point I wish to make, is that as man acquired the first inkling of excess, so did the notion of ‚Äòmanagement‚Äô come to be, as to better acquire such success (in quality of the means, and reliability of execution). But so did the question of ‚Äòother‚Äô, be it near or far, come to be. If you could imagine, such excess, proprtioanlty, affords a slight amount of attention to be spent elsewhere. ‚ÄúOr not on the success at hand.‚Äù And in this state, lies kingship, belief anddiscovery.

So nature is a certain way, as are we. We ought not define either of those yet, entirely at least. Let us start with our observations, and at that experience; for the pain and pleasure I feel right now is quite indicative of what I should attend; at least, if I am injured, then what sense do I even have to wonder if something else should hold myamends.
<br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that we have basic needs, namely food, shelter and water. And nature, making such needs, has been kind to incorporate her own being within our design, in that she has given us the tools to situate ourselves amidst her promising ways. In that, the means to success lies in our dance with nature, the virtue of which lies in how we take such steps. Doing so well, will yield us what weseek.
<br>&emsp;But as we become ingrained to such motions, so does the trouble of warmth and satiety pass. Our care for it lasts; but our struggle in achieving so wains. As this happens, we open ourselves to other troubles nature presents;  or we apply ourselves to our current means, and make them more lucrative and accessible.
<br>&emsp;If you could imagine though a group of stranded people who have barely enough to survive, that despite their current state, that no stability lay. In that, there are but moments of satiety, but no sense of future security. It is the transition from this state within early man to one where his concreteness in the world is established, and he is no longer fleeing from tigers, nor clambering for scraps of food. In that lies management, as the perpetuation of such success is in need of more than a useful tool, but one to wield it; both in skill and employment. Admittedly, this age is not fully known to me, and so the extent to which this ‚Äòmanagerial‚Äô process took place is not entirely clear. But there is a distinction between ‚Äòcultural‚Äô troubles later discovered and the management of that.
<br>&emsp;In a way, people who gathered food were amongst those who could build shelter, find water, fight assailants and so forth. And as such, so long as kinship was present, so would the form of it surround such employments. As it were, as these were all duties and tasks, the matter of there being such things became an issue itself. For a group did not merely have to employ their members for the gain of resources, but had to orient themselves so that employment itself could be had. Because as further duties came to fruition, so did they get covered by the same organization of employment.
<br>&emsp;In that way, pre-ancient marks a time where there was no excess to inspire or warrant management. ‚ÄúFor a tiger is not employed to the hunt, but rather driven, day to day. While a fisherman has a routine, and a reliable one at that ‚Äîat least he looks for such a spot.‚Äù Ancient times are those whereby we surpass the basic quest from nature, and organize ourself to achieve so concretely. That, and as that solidifies, so do we add more employments. And modernity is when we‚Äôve situated ourselves within natures final task, and no longer exist in her response. For the first metallurgist was a result of the first farmer. And indeed, the cares of the farmer, or trouble which his employment solved, gave those to-be craftsmen the openness to discover and see such opportunity.
<br>&emsp;What we‚Äôd better say is that man has come out of his animal ways, into a state of modernizing. Whereby he settled rudimentary layers, added broader ones, and let the latter settled into something solid, and further went by this routine.
<br>&emsp;As it were, our state is best reflected in the custom of knowledge, and how what was once thought to be true relaxes, and accepts new truths. In whole, the tale of modernity, or that origin of kinship, is best summized by the earliest inquirers into indefinite things, and the abstract authority such things took, and the reign they held. I can‚Äôt say the source of the Greeks inquiry; though we can say that they acquired their ability to write from the Middle East. But uniquely, they were of a world which was, on the whole, well written. Their particular use of writing though, came from geography, in that their ‚Äòmanagerial‚Äô form derived from the land gave novel means to differentiate and explore. By that, as the earliest inquirers saw only that which they could with their eyes, so did those in the classical age use the spoils and method of writing. Only, prior truths held much sway, and inquirer into such matters ‚Äîentirely at least- were not fostered. As the farmer permits those in the excess of such advent (in terms of hands needed), so did the stable kinship of the Greek states give a freer edge to their inquiry. ‚ÄúThose in the world at that time had no lesser means, rather the liberty to use it. The Greeks were merely fortunate enough to have enough civil freedom to explore (as man had done before) in contemporary ways.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;And indeed, the uniqueness of the Greeks is perhaps a mark of civil inquiry ‚Äîusing writing and past things written. While the roots of the world had been laid in the inquirers of old ‚Äîthe results of which only grew with time (as they could), and not with genuine reform- the conservative, if not convicted basis which such beliefs produced, gave no way for inquiries born of a newer age. Again, the Greek states gave enough freedom for such inquirers to be made. And while the rest of the world, initially inspired or not, kept down the traditional course, the pure inquiry of the Greeks still lay. And despite the more contemporary view of tradition (in the religions of high antiquity) so did the view born from modernity inspire those who later uncovered such riches.
<br>&emsp;At first the Caliphate found the greek texts, spurring an arabic renaissance near the tip of the millennia. Then, via the charm of that, and the connection (via the crusades) of the east and west, so did those Greek inspired goods re-enter the meditteranean. I must admit some ignorance, but as we all known, the mid way of the millennia saw a dispersion of many folk away from tradition, and into different forms of theology. And my ignorance lies in the connection between the greek inspired scholatiscim (as conducted by those of tradition), and those who saw such work as a motive to something other than such tradition ‚Äîhowever revitalized by the greekmethods.

Virtue is a mark made by demands, in that, of the function which is laid out, so lays virtue by ones able hand. But so do such workers likely have more than one need ‚Äîas remarks the demands. ‚ÄúWhere is thy food? Over there perhaps? It would seem so, but guarded by natural fortuity ‚Äîin distance, skill, Required time, insight.‚Äù That wall to what we seek, as shown by the friction between whats sought and satiety, is the speaker of demands; who says, ‚Äòall those who speak right and well, will pass.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;But man is thus asked to say many things. He collaborates though with others of the species, as some may speak this language, that dialectic, those words. ‚ÄúBy which the discourse between nature is had at multiple points.‚Äù For not even the smoothest of talkers could survive if their charm was only in the words of food. ‚ÄúFor Posiedon must also be greeted, and the God of shelter at that ‚Äî Hepheastus we‚Äôllsay.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;I admit this is not sound entirely, but a fair principle could be, that man, in his sociality, is motivated and successful as so, by the collective virtue instated, and at that the plurality in points of success. ‚ÄúA true complexity of natural discourse.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;That being said, the conduct of man has never been so successful on the basis that there were others around him who held virtues he did not. This in itself is true, but is not the point where one thrives. Rather, the virtues of such collective, and at that the propriety in such variable employment, marks the true point of success. For in that, all needs are in question; and thus, the collective virtue is deemed remarkably so, if it is effective in such unity. If one part fails, then the whole does not succeed. And by that, so do the members without such means, personally fail. That is the dynamic of virtue in a team. 
<br>&emsp;Indeed it is one thing to measure the accounts of such virtue; as one with a skill for navigation may simply be unhad. But it is another, that within the presence of a fully collective means, that so is the management of such collective a virtue in itself.
<br>&emsp;For the process of community is not so easy to say. As we must look at the early remnants of man, and primates at that, to see why the ability for communion is possible. But in terms of our principle, we could say that as one man achieves success in navigation, and another in the foraging of food, that reciprocally they share: as the spoils of one meets the needs of the other: and together, each of their needs are filled ‚Äîvia sharing. But if we could imagine that such harmony is based on an understanding of the other, in that one sees their ability to do one thing, like the other; and by each particular success, the bounty is shared. But as this shared employment ensues, so is there a remark about the needs of the communion. For the individual functions are acted as extensions from a common point ‚Äîto which the shares are returned to. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go west for wood, and you east for stone: meet back here and we‚Äôll share the flame.‚Äù But upon that, as each is settled amidst the shared goods, the question of sustaining such employment is wondered. At least, an inquiry as to the merits of proper management of such collective comes up. As one would level out a path to a reliable means of resources, so would a community establish within themselves the grounds and character to improve such collective. For there may be problems we could afford to solve, via the efficiency. That, or we may improve the means to the ends we‚Äôve already employed ourselves towards. Better yet ‚Äîthough this may simply be how it happens, as opposed to being supposed‚Äî that our attention may catch onto things we had no prior awareness of. For people tend to get sick; but our collective is aimed primarily at gathering shelter and fuel. But so does the solidity of that afford some attention to remedying our illnesses. ‚ÄúEven past that, lies one who, upon sitting up from some ail treatment (to catch their own breath), saw a star twinkling in the sky. And what may that be?‚Äù

We can separate the insights of man by those which are basic, and those in excess. Man, or Homo, is an animal who beat his natural troubles, and became thus suitably fed, quenched and warm. As this occurred though, his attention was drawn to other things; be it elements somewhat local, or figures afar. For a deer runs from a volcano, as would early homo -like all monkeys do. But at some point, after running away, he did not just go upon his day, following the fear he faced, but questioned such danger. ‚ÄúAs if he remembered that he was afraid, and by what.‚Äù The attribution of this to something other worldly is hard to say.  But indeed this is the exchange between naturally compulsive responses, and those which man had to deliberately ascertain. ‚ÄúThere was no longer a loud noise and a bang, but someone hiding with a gun behind thebrush.‚Äù

So I tend to make claims along the lines of virtue, rather than ideals. One sees the world theoretically, and orients it so that, if upon good action, preferred results would shine. While the other, simply adheres to the world as is. Moreso, the conditions which we adhere to are not altogether altered, in action or wish.
<br>&emsp;At that, the difference comes down to who we are as people, in that, of the good, it is through us in and how we are. While the goods of ideals, seem altogether arbitrary, albeit with strong intent.
<br>&emsp;It is hard to say though, for the goods of ideals are found in the realm of philosophy and civics. Meaning, that the ultimate notion of the soul is used as a principle, and ordained to us; with the gumption that we are set and known within such basis. ‚ÄúTo which, our ideal good, is marked by our ideal portion of such basis.‚Äù But such an end is not about our heart and bones, rather the motions of our objective being upon the soul. ‚ÄúWhich is to say, that transcendent or not, that our natural being is set (or sourced) upon something truer; of which theology and pure morality conjectureabout.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;That is one thing though, for the character of metaphysics and all its adjacent is not in any way simple to say. Virtue however, is much easier to expound.
<br>&emsp;For starters, the idea of virtue is, in its form, applicable to the real and ideal world. A saw for instance, has an objective form by which it is virtuous, or sharp; but it also has an ideal form, by which its principle purpose is exhibited; and virtue may be of such. Or in other words, the proper trait it exhibits may be with respect to its real or ideal form.
<br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean to speak of real virtue. Or the property which best responds to the conditions we‚Äôve experienced. ‚ÄúThe nature around us, and what she‚Äôs shown and asked us to adhere to; rather than what we think, if we adhered to, would produced somethingideal.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;For the problem lies in the ends, and the gaze beyond who one simply is. For in that, I notice that a lack of food breeds insatiety, as will a lack of water leave me parched; and too little warmth similarly, or an excess ofwetness.
<br>&emsp;I say all this, for I mean to see the world as something we respond to, rather than surpass, and then oblige some further plea. There may be perils waiting for us, ‚Äòsent by one who cared little that we had otherwise reached success‚Äô; whereby our damnation was due to ignorance and content ‚Äî as if in terms of the world, we‚Äôd won. Equally, this sensibility may afford promise, in that, if we went past such ignorance, then we may reach further and or greenerpastures.
<br>&emsp;This is the true line whereby the critiques of the past meddle with the current scope of philosophy, and the increasing satiety and content of modernity. For in that reign, crumbles the principles of such ‚Äòforeign‚Äô fears and promise. For they seem either uncredible -and at that contrary- or are not so abundantly decent in their reward; as man, in his nature, cares little more than for a fed stomach, quenched mouth, warmth of a home and that of a friend, and a marbling of security and creative access. ‚ÄúIt is a fair critique of those who suggest otherwise, that their motives are born from a lack of the former mentioned.‚Äù For there is indeed, historically, a damning statement by those who profess some greener pasture. ‚ÄúAs if the current grove was riddled with rubble and despair.‚Äù Indeed this is true, for man‚Äôs belly is not always full; nor does any meal promise the next. ‚ÄúBut the promise of satiety is what he truly seeks; rather than the possibility of goods which come outside such condition.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;A great deal of conflict has come by man starving himself down the path to the goods beyond: and those hungry later on, parlayed for the satiety of that. ‚ÄúAt least, in fact, man has not beholdened himself entirely to the lands beyond the world, and at that his earthlyneed."
<br>&emsp;But so lies the motive for humanity, that her brethren may be with fuel and stead. And as one alone does what they can with the tools they have, and a pair of others does so equally but for the gain of both, so is the collective of all people an extension of such efficacy, and the shared customs (as shown by the worth) for such community, so that it may be as ably run, holds but an association of personal agreements, ‚Äòby the reciprocity that each member sees, in their offer and reward‚Äô. Virtue as I say, in this practice, is merely the demonstration of such intent by the people in such association.
<br>&emsp;This may be itself full of principles and ideal, but the basis is one of man, and at that it's possible mean of responding to nature. Generally, the conduct of the community may itself be extold. But the reality is, that such a community is merely a group of individuals exhibiting collective virtue.
<br>&emsp;At that, I mean only to start with words and custom as becomes me and my fellow man. This text is an illustration of that after all; and lives in the world of both my expression (e.g in letters or speech) and subjection (e.g gravity and need tobreath).
<br>&emsp;The past is not unimportant, but simply serves as a datum of experience. The vectors and eligibility of propositions are in full use here, whereby those who offered so a time ago, are measured by the methods used to determinetoday.
<br>&emsp;Of an end though, which is seemingly forever conceded to, and at that in our efforts to define.
<br>&emsp;In that, the core virtue is one of real knowledge, in that someone is aware of and ordained to the character needed for the truest end. It may be one beyond the bounds of earth, and at that, the extent may be one that offers additional promise, or threat. But so, whoever knows, will be in possession of a proper guide. For with such knowledge, they hold the ends to which they must calibrate themselves towards. ‚ÄúWhereby real virtue isbound.‚Äù

People are trying to learn about the world. Doing so requires that they investigate. During so, they experience the world as they are able to, ‚Äòin that one‚Äôs normal vision only sees a certain spectrum of light‚Äô. But as much as their faculties can compute, so will their impressionsapply.
<br>&emsp;In this though, lies the kinds of knowledge one receives, namely those which are natural or supernatural. Of the former, these remark the repeated, or at least seemingly sequential occurrences of the world, and the inscription (by the viewer) of such sequence. The statement of such ebbs and flows amount to laws, in that by whichever basis, so are such motions produced. ‚ÄúAnd laws describe such motions.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;If the matter is not natural, but of a supernatural sort, all this means is that what one experiences is not an occurrence of nature‚Äôs sequence, but an instance instead. In that, lies the heart of miracles, visions and reactions from a supposed other world. An augur for instance, sees a birds flight and interprets that as meaning something for the natural world. ‚ÄúAs if the tectonic plates below caused a motion of the bird, and gave the impression that other objects would be subject to a certain motion within their own relation to the plates.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;Distinct from that is a messiah, which is not merely an instance or act which corresponds with the baser motions beneath, but is an exhibition of such basis in object form. The bird that an auger sees is not itself an insight, but rather what such motions suggest of the basis below. A messiah on the other hand is akin to such basis taking on the form of a bird, and flying in a elaborate way: by which something clear and deliberate is given in terms of insight, rather than a conjectural supposition of what the flight of an ordinary bird means.
<br>&emsp;It is true though that such a prime being is not necessarily natured, for they may be a normal object (with communicative potential) which is intimately linked with the basis; or they be the basis itself, merely formed in a way that allows for communication.
<br>&emsp;In either case, the conduct of such being is one of alteration and insight. For they may literally turn water into wine, or share what God has told them. And it is not unreasonable to suspect that someone listening to the words of the latter does so because they‚Äôve seen (or heard of) acts of the former.
<br>&emsp;In this though, lies the critical divide between science and divine based philosophy. For both, per the core of philosophy, seek a truth (and by that permit the presence) of something deeper than the surface level appearance of the world. ‚ÄúAs if there were more than what we commonly saw.‚Äù But in terms of what they are trying to explain, or find the basis for rather (of such appearance), so does such subject come about through natural or supernatural means. For one who sees a miracle, or hears the words of a spirit, will seek the explanation of that. While someone who observes the moon‚Äôs motion‚Äôs, and ascribes such steps as reminiscent of dynamical laws, will seek the basis of that. As Newton said, ‚Äòby whom and to whichever end I do not know, but of what is governed it is these motions; and such motions are understood by these descriptions.‚Äù Saying, in other words, that via such descriptions, we understand the objects which are under (or on) some basis.  Philosophy is the admittance of such basis, and not then a denial of the real world, nor an acceptance of rhythmic laws. To be fair, the things which the laws express, or illustrate, has no definite limit in terms of what can be known; nor is it unfair to suspect that as our understanding (and descriptions) reach greater depths, that the basis for such things will become known. Or, better said, that what we mean when philosophizing, that beneath even the understood surface, lies a basis to that; but so may the basis of that be itself definite, rather than metaphysical. 
<br>&emsp;Metaphysics, or a transcendant basis, may be possible, or it may simply be real ‚Äî or not meta, but definite, and not transcdenat, but entire within the reality which there‚Äôd be transcendence of.
<br>&emsp;In that way perhaps, it might be better to ascribe the confidence in the latter as a faith in reason, in that if we are to be complete in that way, then we will have understood and explained all things within reality ‚Äîwith no transcendent need.
<br>&emsp;Bringing this back, it is all too common for ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô instances of things not seemingly real, to serve as either indicators or proof of something transcendent. Beyond the source of speech and thinking, the alteration of water into wine is not something which, in a pure reality, is consistent with the rest of things. Thermodynamics for one, does not permit it.

I don‚Äôt care for the news, despite its good intent, for the criticisms and ideals which it presents seem too bare to match the enormity of the world. Locally, I see some merit; but it is not uncommon for ‚Äòlocal‚Äô to equate to several million people, and at that many large towns. ‚ÄúNot even a neighbourhood is the metric for constituent pieces, but towns themselves -but are they sosmall?‚Äù
<br>&emsp;And the question then comes to virtue, in that we, as people within a community, have some sort of obligation to each other. That, and as the scale of such community broadens, so do our duties extend. For if we are truly people of the world, and at that one with all on earth, then so do we have virtues of thesort.
<br>&emsp;The problem though is one of excess. For the purpose of society, whole and small, is to produce what each individual can offer at an excessive degree. ‚ÄúWe all put something in, and more than what we could do alone come‚Äôs out.‚Äù And indeed this is how society has functioned for a millennia. That, and the notion of collective virtue has been around almost as long: for the virtues which co-operation supports, need virtues which organize such support. Both in terms of ample and opportune employment (of each member), and the distribution of each members contribution. Moreover, the act of determination and execution of such organization becomes a role in itself; which has virtues of its own.
<br>&emsp;It is worth noting too, that the virtues of each member is in part within their unified nature within a collective; so that those who are hunters would hunt with the collective in mind, while those who governed would do so with their purpose (as governors) in mind.
<br>&emsp;In that, we say that collective virtue is defined within the general realm of communal structure, and  each members subjection to it. ‚ÄúSo that they may not fret about the excess which they‚Äôd otherwise have, being sent evenly to others around. Each member ought have eachother inmind.‚Äù
</div><button class="edit-btn"></button><input type="checkbox" class="bookmark-box"> </div> </div><div id="content"><div class="text-piece" data-id="piece2"><div class="title-display"></div><div class="text-body">
What we are going to assume, is that man is an animal, and at that something with needs; which is to say a relation with nature, who both supplies and demands (in efficacy); moreso, has she gracefully made us with those tasks in mind, and at that formed us to be in need of the results of such task. This is what weare.
<br>&emsp;We also must assume that we are social animals, in that of such tasks, we both recognize the worth in cooperation and have the means to do so. In this lies a property of virtue, namely the resourceful aspect of it, in that if one is in need of food, then the virtue required is not only in character but ingenuity, in that the route to such ends can be seen, but executed on to. For example, if one‚Äôs ingenuity can see that a shell is liable to be smashed (and offer the food inside), then the trait which provides such recognition is in need of a paired trait of dextrousness, and at that craftiness, in order to conjure and harness the thing which smashes. All in all, our recognition of cooperation is one which requires the ability to see others as viable benefit, and then act in ways that facilitate such unity. ‚ÄúMans basic social virtue is in seeing others as allies, and treating them with as is appropriate for reciprocity.‚Äù And beyond the smaller locale, a broadening of such union may neccessitate collective virtues, as to permit organization of the many, and at that the concession of each to the whole. ‚ÄúThis extent of man‚Äôs basic social virtue is perhaps one of reproach and sense, in that two hands being better than one may be so in the furthest sense, but thus require the facilitation of such community. To which man‚Äôs baser virtue is paired with a sense of reason, as to consent to the will of such virtue.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;At that, it is fair to say that man must be reasonable so much as he is virtuous, for what the latter suggests (in proportion to its scope) bears weight upon the formers presence, as to guide what may otherwise be contrary to the promise of such virtue. ‚ÄúWait my friend and see, and your conceit to such community will bear fruits greater than your own impulses andeffort.‚Äù
</div><button class="edit-btn"></button><input type="checkbox" class="bookmark-box"> </div> </div><div id="content"><div class="text-piece" data-id="piece2"><div class="title-display"></div><div class="text-body">
As it were, this sense of collective virtue is not itself a marker for an age. Man may be social and collective, but in a merely minor, if not localdegree.
<br>&emsp;What separates primitive man from those ancient is in the unity of such locales; so that a tribe has to deal with other tribes, and at that convene. Surely the transition from primitive to ancient ways saw times where such ‚Äòconvening‚Äô was unfruitful. But eventually communities bigger than tribes ensued, becoming states, and empires of those.
<br>&emsp;It might be fair to think in terms of civility, and by that recognize villages as the earliest civil communes. Their comparison to a tribe is not clear, but the presence of infastrastucre is surely a dsitnguihshing factor.
<br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that villages, or civil communes, interact with those of the same sort, and at that, broaden the collective into something akin to a state, or kingdom. These, to be clear, are what empires are composed of, in that the realms of Africa, Spain, Italy, France and Central Europe constituted the empire of Rome. While each province was a mesh of smaller (village like)constituents.
<br>&emsp;At this point, I am not clear on the ideals of a collective beyond that of a village. And historically, it seems that such attempts were more on the selfish end. And I must admit that the peculiar facts of that are not known to me.  ‚ÄúPerhaps I wish not to grieve over such ‚Äòconquests‚Äô, and at that graze over this state of empires and states.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;Beyond the impetus, it is somewhat fair to presume that such union of smaller collectives was done through conflict. Indeed, I can see the value in the world as it is; at least it seems unlikely that a plethora of villages would each build their own factories and transmit systems. Thus there seems merit in higher collectives by virtue of the greater amount of resources that the administrators can expel. I also think that the impetus for ancient collectives was mystical, in that those of higher rank in the smaller communes were seen as exhibitors (and at that earthen judges) of the Gods; and that by the convicted quest to have all foreigners (alike the natives) submit to such King, so the impetuslay.
</div><button class="edit-btn"></button><input type="checkbox" class="bookmark-box"> </div> </div><div id="content"><div class="text-piece" data-id="piece2"><div class="title-display"></div><div class="text-body">
As it were, lands that united themselves into kingdoms and empires, grew more reach then those which remained ‚Äòpastural and village like‚Äô. This can explain the ability for Europe to colonize the Americas, despite there being people present. If such folks had extended the scope of their community, then so their stamp be in place. But a countries power far supersedes those of individual clans.
<br>&emsp;In an equal manner, the legacy of knowledge pours from those who acquired the most of it. And those who could, did so according to their means, in both skill and liberty. For the freest thinkers of primitive times had nothing but their wandering gaze ‚Äîand broad definitions. While those with precise language and the method of writing could ask and ponder in more elaborate ways. ‚ÄúFor more had already been via written hands.‚Äù But so do such means require the freedom to use them. And past the advent of culture -and its mystical side- so were blanked questions discouraged ‚Äîfatally in some instances.
<br>&emsp;Along these lines, the Greeks were part of a time which had come from the prior age of Mesopotamia -and her findings. From this, beyond any derived context, they strictly found the means for writing. Paired with that was the structure of their states, which were quite stable due to their limits via geography. From that, nestled a relatively high amount of freedom to pursue both inquiry and craft. Per the former, the Pre-Socratics, Sophists and Hellenes lay.
<br>&emsp;As it were, the lands around Greece progressed as all others had civilly, namely in the lining of states into empires. In the case of Greece, the Northern realm of Macedon incorporated those in the southern peninsula. And those by the Romans forthwith.
<br>&emsp;I cannot speak to the civil state of the Arabs, but via the uncovered Greek texts they were inspired to in the ways they inquired, or that they should inquire at all. Regardless, a middle eastern age of inquiry ensued. And to those later associated with them did the spoils (of prior Greek thought) continue.
<br>&emsp;The point, is that the world operates a certain way. And generally, most of it behaves in the same manner. Only, the reason for any present motive is likely born from some past initiative ‚Äîi.e. the primitive notion of a leaders divine right, and at that endowment to all property and folk (be it foreign or native). But, the natural expression of people outside antiquate ways, makes for developments which stick around, ‚Äòeven when such folk are smothered by the surrounding states and their tradition‚Äô.
<br>&emsp;Indeed, this is the mark of the Greeks, in that they were simply those of higher ancients who purely thought.
<br>&emsp;But the question is of our civility, and the manner in which it broadens, and for which ideal end. For I want to say that the current state of the world is simply one born of all the pieces settling together, and at that by an age which was prompted up (initially) by such decree to expand, and at that vie for lands and right. ‚ÄúAll those native, born and led by such decree, saw all things beyond them as property of theirs. At least to be.‚Äù Indeed, as remarked by those broadly conquesting, that those who lived in their sought for lands were but barbarians, and sometimes savages. For the latter marks a sort of perceived conduct of a people; while the former term is but a disintciton between those native and not. ‚ÄúThey are barbaric who are not of us.‚Äù Which is indeed a relative term, and at that possible within any character ‚Äîas all can see who they are, and who isnot.
</div><button class="edit-btn"></button><input type="checkbox" class="bookmark-box"> </div> </div><div id="content"><div class="text-piece" data-id="piece2"><div class="title-display"></div><div class="text-body">
The notion of locality, and at that nativity, within early tribes, is to me an anthropological mark of people. Just as we assume, or at least mention our ability to socialize, so ought we include the notion of fear, and of what. Whatever then spurs conflict is one thing, or for what ends rather, but that there were ‚Äòothers‚Äô is not surupisring.  ‚ÄúCollective virtue has never been a matter of people, but our ownfolk.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;The reality though is that collectives are governed beyond their basic ends. And by that it is important to note how certain issues become addressed through the collective. In that lies the mystical findings of man, and the incorporation of such truths into the functions which the tribe provides.
<br>&emsp;For it has been said that community allows for efficiency, and at that spexiliaztion; either in the ways that current things or done, or for new things which get noticed in this state of excess. By my accounts this is where spirits and folklore were born. The details regarding it, as in the case of the motive and effects of food and conquest, are not known. But it seems fair (as in those others) to fit in generally.
<br>&emsp;If I knew more, I might be able to mingle conquest and piety together. It seems that the heart of the latter came about prior to any extensive acts of the former. I cannot say entirely though that said latter caused such former acts. Those seem to be based on a discrimination of whats native and foreign. The motivation could be to destroy such things beyond the locale, or to assimilate them. At least their views may be self involved, in that they thought they had rights to all ‚Äîpartocualry of those in leadership roles. Divinity surely had an influence then.
<br>&emsp;Overall, it is not hard to see that as the bounds of earth were settled, and for whichever reason conflated ‚Äîfirst into villages, then kingdoms, empires. And such states brought with them that tradition of piety. Which by my accounts is the source of all things bigotry. For it is one thing for ‚Äòall things foreign, or not native‚Äô, to be deemed a threat; as not even deer are accepting of much more than their local herd. It is another though, for the motions of such discrimination to have antagnositc motives curried by religion. Thats not to say there isn‚Äôt conflict born from natural ends. But of the direction born by religion, I‚Äôd say the source of elitism and genocide spring fromthere.
<br>&emsp;Again, the discirmante conduct of man is more or less natural. Only, the twisting of such impressions can make the destructive interests moreso, or at least create a classist attitude regarding those assimilated.
<br>&emsp;Better said, the separation between folk is one thing; but religion, and or piety born of a certain locale, only makes those within that locale more unique, and at that inherently different than those around. And whether such difference spurs elitism or genocide, so is the native sense one of further distinction (regarding all thatsforeign).

As it were, the advent of man modernizing begins 3.3 mya with the fist discovery of lithic technology.
<br>&emsp;As it is known, the neolithic is the point of the Stone Age where agriculture emerged. But besides that, the resounding feature of each period of the Stone Age is of the lithic techniques used for toolmaking.
<br>&emsp;Within the lower paleolithic, the initial lithic mode was lukemian, while the predominant form was Odean. At 1.7Mya this transitions toAchean.			
<br>&emsp;The mid paleolithic marks the beginning of art, social structures, burials and things alike. Theres also a mention of trade. Within this period Homo Sapien spread out fromAfrica.
<br>&emsp;The Upper paleolithic begins 50Tya, and begins broader social activities and art ‚Äîpetroglyphs(carvings).
<br>&emsp;Mesolithic ‚Äî 20tya to7tya
<br>&emsp;Neoolithic marks agriculture and advance tools for harvesting plants. Large scale structures. Began, notably at least, in the Fertile Crescent ‚Äî Euphrates and Tigrisriver.

Ideally, we‚Äôd know how things come together, and thus have some guide for the time ahead the present.
<br>&emsp;But this seems unnecessary, and at that not to be so. For we have said, generally, that considering our need to breath, eat and sleep, that so hath nature given us the means to such ends; but in that, required of us to be a certain way, principally (as in disciplined) and withskill.
<br>&emsp;The question, is if a group of individuals exhibits collective virtue, what does that mean for the individual themselves? Perhaps the modern source of this conundrum, whereby the form of such collective is off, brings up questions of bravery andprotest.
<br>&emsp;But in that, I see but a moment ahead, and at that one‚Äôs vitriol in the imbalance of that moment to be. In terms of the future, so does momentum and trajectory lay. And by that, the vitriol of the moment is exchange for calmer virtues; one‚Äôs which exhibit themselves with respect to the whole of our days, rather than the evident moment.
<br>&emsp;Its important to note, that by the annals of consistency of anisotropy, that the form of things at hand bears more assumptions than the natural need (and our according natural presence) to eat and sleep, but also sense, worry, fear, and by that see beyond what is definite and clear, in those things of an abstract or mysterious sort. As man‚Äôs expression had the time and developed means to paint bulls on the wall, so was he able to express his notice of the sky, the moon, devastation, and common disturbances such as illness ordeath.
<br>&emsp;It is important, and at that interesting, to explore the basis of these assumptions ‚Äîin our needs and impressionability. But I‚Äôd say, for the moment, that we can merely express that collective virtue is one, that in all senses of frailty, ought one fix such, or address it atleast.
<br>&emsp;For one permits themselves being equitable within the collective, and by that, subject to the custom of such collective -be it in the vibes of each member, or those which are determined, and at that managed.
<br>&emsp;Besides any recent examples, it is our point to note that one‚Äôs place in the collective is not entirely made by their reasonable exceptence of its ways, but in that a more civil reward from their participation; and at that, a liberty to do as they leisurely, craftily and or curiously please. Mistaken truths cause friction here; but our ideal remains.
<br>&emsp;This is where I struggle. For the American dream is that each member has the rights and freedom to pursue what they please. And by that, each family which comes, be it with nothing or a historic all, can act liberally, and at that via their own interest. What is proper though, is that such interest be in line with the ways of the collective. Despite holding the right to suffrage and thought, so mustn‚Äôt they committ theft or assault, and at that coerce someone to doing something out of custom.
<br>&emsp;My ignorance though prevents me from stating the ‚Äòinhumane‚Äô policies instigated or disgenuine activity. Are corporations a vice to the collective, and at that preachers and belligerents. Saying who these are, and in by which whole educate, is not easy to say. Though much public information is. Expressed around such disputants.
<br>&emsp;I can only say, that if someone is wrong, or inappropriately behaved ‚Äîfor none, outside the military, have any permission to commit violent acts- that their place in being so within the complex of the industrial age is one that wholly derived from baser principles. And necessarily, the various parts of that complex ought be considered when we judge those involved in such level. For in the collective virtue, their may arrive the presence (and by that submission) to a charter, whereby certain rules and custom are agree‚Äôd upon for the functioning (and at that benefit) of the collective. In that though, there may be additional posts, such as the facilitators of such laws, and the judgement of those in contrast. Here lies the birth of courts, and at that administrators of the collective policy. By this decree, the need of which is born from the agree‚Äôd upon structure of the collective, so is the employment of such role in need of one‚Äôs compribale in such task. Thus came legislators, litigants and judges.
<br>&emsp;My point, is that if we are to judge a litigant and the the quality of their litigating conduct, ought we know the form and virtue inbided which such person is evaluate against.  ‚ÄúWhat is a good lawyer, and a proper one at that? And ought we have our own sense of why there is propiety at all, and at that contextual aims (for which virtues are valuedtraits).‚Äù
<br>&emsp;At any rate, this is just a method of propiety, in that we hold our criticisms and contrition at bay, less we have a solid basis to judge on. What the real question is, or the main one, is the duty of those in the collective to partake in such roles of litigation or legislative creation ‚Äîand so forth to military operations, civil engineering and so forth. For it is one thing to say that a litigant is bad; while it is another to say that, all things considered, that my place as a non litigant is not to do with the business of litigation. At that point, it is perhaps right that such realms of the collective ought have their own committees and checks, as to suitably manage such affairs. For my place as a shoemaker does not imbibe me with the proper sense of a litigants abilities or conduct. But this evaluation need not be self managed, or at least internally managed (by other litigants), but by a focused group of those educated in the proper ways of such litigants; and like a enforce and or official of the law, who holds reign over those breaking it, so do such monitoring committees serve as a suitable enforce over the field of litigants.

My thoughts always come back to virtue, in that we are all subject to something, and at that, virtuous by our effective oblige. What this is in contrast to is hard to say; but perhaps a fair note is that the things were subject to, truly, are not able to be changed, merely responded to.  The difference is seemingly one of history, and how people see the obligations placed upon us as done so though the wills of other people; and at that seem liable forchange.
<br>&emsp;This is not base enough, by my counts. For indeed, laws, states, economies and office have come about; and beyond their own arrangement, so has primitive thought influenced the succeeding generations involvements (in such arrangement). But the source of this all is upon those base necessities; which even upon the fairest of states, still rests upon the unyielding demands of nature, and at that our virtuousoblige.
<br>&emsp;As it were, false pretence has born a lineage of native divinity, and at that a contrast was those of other nativities. This has been incorporated into the sense and structure of modern states; at least the former quality was part of the classical irons, while the latter was ingrained to those medieval. Even though industrial states have rid the premises of such tradition, so do the liberated folks have no lineage of their own. Despite the lands being at liberty for them, so are they incapable, by their previously held position. ‚ÄúThus the critique‚Äôs of modernity lay; not in their motive and course, but the history of those partaking in the lanes: and some being steady footed compared toothers.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;This is an odd sentiment. For the specifics really don‚Äôt matter. Instead, the notion of virtue is binary in its address, in that we either head for the ideal, and let the validity of that even things out; or we locally, or via the moment address, and at that resolve ourselves to the status of the collective, rather than its end.
<br>&emsp;For the inequality of folk is more or less born from classist mindsets. That, and the idea of locality, and the ceasing domain beyond such borders -by which those outside are not of right. Conquest arrives here, as doesslavery.
<br>&emsp;But let‚Äôs consider for a moment a native family, who is not subject (or has been) to retched inequities, but simply held lineage in the heart of a powerful land. If they are workers in an economy, then what ought they receive in terms ofsympathy?
<br>&emsp;Perhaps its better to remark the reasons which distributed custom and roles within the baser societies, and at that, made way for states which proliferated the inequity we see today.
<br>&emsp;For my belief is that, beyond something true, that the inequity towards those of contrary sexes, orientations, faiths or ethnicity, is purely born from a compounded culture of ignorance, mistaken pretence, and by all that, an evident lack of inquiry ‚Äîfor none without the clasp of common consent, thinks purely and sees people as anything but equal.
<br>&emsp;And thankfully, the validity of the ancient ways gave way to the want of something more reputable and modern; by which pure attempts were made (with modern means) to assess the world and what it means. Whereby, the notion of religion remains, but beyond ancient views; along with liberty becoming present; and developing truly by the friction of precedence, and at that the world‚Äôs status as would permit (admittedly young liberal) views that bore complete equity.
<br>&emsp;We have reached this purity though. At least, we as in those common and or reminiscent of the West. Here, and by all alike, the affairs and being of sexes, orients, faiths and ethnic identities hold worthwhile truth; and by that, are accounted for equally within the basis by which collective virtue lay. ‚ÄúFor there are none who we‚Äôd call man, who do not measure to the status of members, and at that contributors to citizenry andrule.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;It is only our nearly modern case, whereby the finishings of this war (of new and ancient) is but a battlefield of wounded and deprived. For indeed the battle for humanity is won. At least our demise is all together. And beyond the cares for our lasting time as one‚Äôs whole and of unity, so is such union full of stragglers, and at that those bolted behind. For some can not even partake in the liberties now given. ‚ÄúFor many paths require one to be so tall, liquid, able.‚Äù And the result of those liberties being unpresent prior, means that some people have nothing -and thus have no means to begin.
<br>&emsp;I am not sure if this is just part of the collective, that it would account for and service what it can those who were let down by its prior inefficiency. Veterans seem to be treated this way. At that point though, besides the efficiency of our fortunes and excess, what is the course for those with nothing? What resources and or opportunities are available for people in that state? ‚ÄúIn this newly open world, where is the potential for those whose first step is tobegin?‚Äù

What is the purpose of all our efforts? Is it not the liberty of all, to see and do as they please?
<br>&emsp;Perhaps, it is truly bring our nature in line with that the world, for harmony. There the gift of virtue lies, in liberty namely, and at thatpeace.
<br>&emsp;But the ebbs of our nature is such that the attempt to harmonize brings fear; as our motivations based on mystery bear upon us further confusion, and at that reserve. By some mechanic the truth comes out, and our hesitance seeps.
<br>&emsp;I just wonder if we always knew that there were no Gods, and that the mechanics which bore us need for breathe also bore the air and currents, that the efficacy in meeting such needs would be a complete and utter success. For I believe the tales tell us that meeting the demands of our animal needs bore insight to further problems: namely death and the pleasing of God. But so much of the reoncilliation with that has created depravity, ‚Äòas everyone push each other aside in order to reach thetop‚Äô.
<br>&emsp;As it were, the aim is always reconciliation, but of our nature with the world. In that lies an evidentprosperity.
<br>&emsp;The oddity of man is in his attempts to solve ‚Äòancient problems‚Äô -as compared to those primitive and innate, that much of the struggle to modernityarrived.
<br>&emsp;In a broad sense, the peril of the stone age was in those unable to harmonize with nature -whereby they‚Äôd starve and whither.  While the modern peril is one where people fight each other, ‚Äòlike two babies yanking at the same toy‚Äô. The motive is the same, but the ancient sentiments bring false pretence to ‚Äòothers‚Äô, and their right to be, or at least beequal.
<br>&emsp;I do admit some ignorance in the function, or at least mechanism by which fear is produced. But I submit the notion of a nightmare, and how impressionability, unfamiliarity, and an otherwise lack of similar (if not associated) definition, can lead to such conception. ‚ÄúIf only in a dream.‚Äù But so, in life, can we be misled, or mistaken at least, and by that deem something to be problematic; or at least feel a problem is present. ‚ÄúFor it is not a far stretch to describe earlier points of man, where he not only say the volcano as a threat, but an instigator ofit.‚Äù
<br>&emsp;If were thinking ideally, or at least in terms of virtue, then we can presume the notion of communal harmony, or group relations, and how the mistaken actions were done in such relations, or at least internally followingcombination.
<br>&emsp;In that way, it is hard not to say that if your part of a community, and some of its members are suffering from previous struggle, that your part of the collective is in helping them. At least, as you act with the collective in mind in positivity, so ought you act with it in mind if there are parts of it which have succumb to negativity. ‚ÄúNormally, we win, and share the spoils; and collective virtue is submitting yourself as to be equal to others. But if we loose, then we at best hold eacother up in our loss, and persevere through the trouble. And if some of us are fine, then perhaps our role is to help those who arenot."
