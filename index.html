                <div class="text-body">So I can actually think for a moment.
                    <br>&emsp;Foremost, I wish to have kids. Our desire is not palletable, but our aim is in line with
                    our
                    natural expectations. Similar to our agreement with death, so do we see children as likely; and to
                    such
                    presumed end, I am happy, and pleased. As for their rearing, I see simplicity heralding their home
                    and
                    stead, along with a honorable union with the goods and harmony of the world. I see us rearing them
                    to speak
                    well and clearly, to listen, to walk, talk, breathe and run. And from there, for their own
                    application, or
                    our shared steps abroad, so we'll be. I understand the pre-requisite of money, in that a room, a
                    stroller,
                    food and diapers are required. Nor is there a short amount of odd preperations: an emergency, check
                    ups,
                    glasses, dental. But these are either mended by simpler habits; are not so precarious in their
                    acquisition;
                    or can be attended to when and on the day. Moreover, the basis for chidlren is a dutiful one; and in
                    that,
                    our pecuniary needs are oriented to. In that, assuming we have someone who was as interested as I to
                    birth
                    and raise, and thus share the load of attention and means, that so will we, in our correspoding
                    means, have
                    likely measures to bend them further, and by that, address any momentary or forseen requirments.
                    <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I can say that our draw to this is but a formality. As I do not have a
                    spark
                    inside me, nor any emebers which our relations are kindling. All it seems, is that on this path we
                    stand,
                    akin to death. The mode of our life is such, that progress, the abscence of contributing a new
                    member, and
                    our otherwise prior interests, leads me not but to a proprtioned conclusion. Namely, that of our
                    life, in
                    its investment and regard, ought it be, in expectation and according preference, tailored with such
                    points
                    in mind. Our regard is not so heavy though, for such a path is not mighty in its horizon. "For we
                    may then
                    see, with proper deeds and response; nor can we offer but a little preperation; as such matters are
                    by
                    nature, laid out."
                    <br>&emsp;What is right and wrong then is not, in this case, guilded by any sense that we ought have
                    children now, or shortly. There's no civil or customary need for us to do so. And indeed, little of
                    such
                    sentiment is ever pressed upon me.
                    <br>&emsp;Oddly though, I think that our happiness is the lever by which others express themselves:
                    for in
                    that, in cheer and candour, they wish. Yet the irony, is that what said happiness amounts to is not
                    so
                    clear, except what I can only pin point as a basic need to be true to those future points of
                    children and
                    death.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, we tend to recieve suggestions along the lines of that which would furnish me
                    with
                    fortune and friends. Namely, that of a bigger house, and a acceptable sociallife.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, these remarks feel unfiltered or assessed; as no one ever asks you if you are
                    really
                    happy. At least, if they do, there is seldom an agreement on what such happiness means. For even if
                    I am,
                    and then begin to slip, the resorted expression is one of ventures for the sake of things esteemed
                    to make
                    you happy. But our prior happiness, as we politely claimed, is not concluded as being poor in
                    princiuple,
                    but rather futily achieved.
                </div><button class="edit-btn"></button><input type="checkbox" class="bookmark-box">

                <div class="text-body">
                    So their are two main elements: duty and happiness. The form of the latter is all that's worth
                    remarking,
                    while the former is guilded by our baser needs, and the mode theiracquired.
                    <br>&emsp;Surrounding this though is the direction of our lives. For what we need is not so ardently
                    agreed
                    upon. Nor, is the form of happiness heralded in terms of propiety, or even merrit. "Which is to say,
                    that
                    the matter of happiness, be it crumby or pure, may not be deeemd important, or appropriate even: as
                    duty may
                    hold the our deepestcare."
                    <br>&emsp;In that, it is quite easy to say that our desired form, is one where the good we
                    experience is
                    ocnsistent, merrily met, and of a wholesome sort; as to accomodate such qualities, whilst also being
                    tender,
                    warm and sweet. Nor are we given much more difficulty in saying that our needs are so as would make
                    us
                    secure; that if we had some thing, that we would be full, fed and sure. Moreover, we might say, that
                    our
                    means to such things is done via ourselves or some collective: and that at some extent of the latter
                    is
                    society made, and an according economoy where our particulare actions within the efficiencies of the
                    whole,
                    treats us to a return in which we can apply to such products of the whole.
                    <br>&emsp;None of this is hard tosay.
                    <br>&emsp;But that we ought fear our dreasm, as if some messenger is suggesting something; be it of
                    fear or
                    oppertunity. Or whether or not our foresight of death is one that speaks of peace and certain
                    finality, or
                    rather shines upon us with some promise; one of which we can see, relish in, and from there
                    anticpate, but
                    also surrender to and oblige, as pertains to esteemed requisites for entry. These things, alongside
                    many
                    others --in both identities and meaning- are not so clear.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I sit then is in a state of private confidence. A state of which, by all things
                    likely, I am
                    not deterred or afraid by what is apt to come. And as such, I may personally be, in the moment
                    happily, and
                    sturdy to the future tocome.
                    <br>&emsp;But a matter of deep importance remains. One of which characteries the nature of a
                    species, and by
                    that, a feature which nearly all living things share: progeny.
                    <br>&emsp;For these remarks of ours are not merely attributions to mysteries ahead of us, but also
                    matters
                    of the dearest concern; for upon our natural stride, whereby another is birthed upon us, that so in
                    our
                    provision of security and happiness (for them), do these obscurities lay. Our time is admittedly
                    garnished
                    by age and sensibility. And despite our contemporary release from primitive views and superstition,
                    so are
                    we are least sure and bounded by the strenght in our appraoch, to whichever future lays. One's
                    parenting
                    though is not, in general, or in any particularly esteemed way, propitiated by such confidence. For
                    we may
                    raise them to be a strong as us, whereupon they approach the mysteriees of life with equal might and
                    gust.
                    But so are we playing with the roots of another, as opposed to our own secure trunk. For we can
                    already see,
                    think, consider and align. Our child though is relying on us to do much of this for them. And
                    whether it is
                    our action they need, or mere guidance, so mustn't we compare our relation to the world to their
                    own.

                    from bad habits mind you, but a whithering of our good ones. The principles to be fair regarding
                    such
                    efforts are not in themselves poor. But our general momentum has been tilted from the recent months;
                    nor
                    have the principles had time to settle and embellish themselves. This is indeed the flow of ourlife.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, all that matters is our time ahead. Nearby, I see the oppertunity to find some
                    security,
                    in that we may work at Walmart or Superstore. This will be nice, and indeed is neccessary to stay
                    comfortably at home. I cannot say this will procure stability though. At least, in our muddied
                    state, I can
                    see that our time at home will not produce what we seek further ahead. Indeed, our muddiedness does
                    not let
                    us be content with what we have; for if we were, then such far off things would not be either
                    hankered
                    towards, nor with grievence at their distance.
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed, it is an akward time, as I am not so privy to communicate: it being the holidays
                    afterall.
                    Despite that, we've made three attempts thus far, each ending in a miss. I don't fear the clock in
                    regards
                    to a potential leave in Februrary; but knowing if our course is such would be nice to know.
                    Especially so we
                    may communicate and come to an understanding. Dad is leaving in a few days for Palm Springs, as is
                    Mom
                    leaving for Kamloops. And so the months end will come, and we may potentially be going. Right now
                    though, I
                    am not sure what we're going to do. I fret not at the choices, only that I am both lingering or
                    halted from
                    learning about the one I oughtmake.
                    <br>&emsp;I say we phone as we can. I would rather work at West Walmart, but East or Superstore will
                    do. My
                    stake in them saying yes, albeit a nice turn of events, is not so tight. In fact, I think it in many
                    ways
                    wrong. If we were more secure, through ourselves, then the comfort and harmony would be alright. I
                    might
                    even lean in and find some steadyness. But I know in my heart, nor am excused form the thought upon
                    any
                    personal waiving, that somewhere else is where I'm meant togo.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, I mean to invest myself. If only because there is oppertunity and need to do
                    so. Such
                    needs are small, nor is their prescence near. But the stability of our life is such, that in terms
                    of the
                    happiness which we seek, ought we be on route, or in line at least, to something which our happiness
                    woudl
                    be find to float towards. We need not rush, but our personal efforts relish the liberty to sink into
                    themselves; but such an agreement comes when your foresight is checked by appropriate actions. What
                    this
                    deems then, is not so much that we would reach forward with haste, or be trepidatious so long as we
                    weren't
                    now as we see to be latter, rather that we were merely on course, directed, and set to reach such
                    end by our
                    natural paces. This is why we felt the need to leave home in Kamloops, as we knew that our time
                    there was
                    not so kept. And despite being happy, I found it hard to sink in and be truly so; for I knew change
                    was
                    coming. Such change though comes from a sort of honesty to what is required to stability. I don't
                    seek
                    children, but I do recognize our future place with them. The slightest bit of current happiness is
                    enough
                    not to worry about that; but as even one string of our current peace is tugged at, so does our
                    apparent
                    incongruety with such future become apparent.

                    So a mistake was once made. It occured when we choose to leave our post, of which our later
                    reflections
                    would reveal to have been prosperous. But in any case, we left, and moved north to a comfortable
                    home.
                    Indeed cicrumstance was what called us. But our willingness to go was far too keen and excitable
                    than our a
                    call for dutyreflected.
                    <br>&emsp;In this, I have learned that happiness is not some hidden treause, laid upon broken glass
                    and
                    smolten steel. As Montainge says, 'it lies out in the open, pleased to be treated (and thus
                    beneovlent) by
                    any who would take her hand'. I can't quite say when this remark came to pass, but I do recall
                    thinking that
                    our congruency with the world, or affibility at least, in terms of our 'hand to happiness', was
                    neither
                    unacceptibility, or with much difficulty to manifest. I have learned things, and indeed, our
                    adolscence has
                    lost its youtfull edge. But I mention this only to highlight our naivety and slant of incongruence,
                    with
                    respect to our being happy in a worldy way. For I do submitt that our views on this matter were not
                    so open
                    or admitted in times past; where we were either agasint the common way, leary about our place in it,
                    and at
                    any rate resolved to live outside of it, or merely to the extent required. "I seldom thought,
                    outside of
                    wishes and fancy, that I would freely and fullystride."

                    So the strides of our life are duly met by circumstance. The weather, for instance, changes the day,
                    which
                    then changes the days ahead of that; which in effect, contributes to the periodcoming.
                    <br>&emsp;Our resolve though is merely to learn, so that when it rains, or time has come with her
                    many
                    demands, we may fruitfullyoblige.
                    <br>&emsp;In this, I know foremost that our happiness needs rest. From this though, there lies the
                    trouble
                    in ceasing acitivity, for the external motions of your life are leaned on, as is your own liberty to
                    breathe, and be. In many ways, I could describe this mode as one of stability and progress. For my
                    home does
                    come into question; whereby the extent to which I can see, by virtue of our stability, bears upon me
                    a
                    horizon which my rest is not angst to reach. For the alternative is one, whereup you become still,
                    see
                    little, and feel like little is shown ahead: whereby you wish to further yourself. In line with
                    that, is the
                    sentiment of progress. Rest does not exclusivley fall on this notion, as our working stress and
                    occupied
                    place, may also wish for some promise ahead. This is merely an eligibility though, or rather some
                    sense of
                    oppertunity which your natural strides can meet. For I do not neccesarily need that which said
                    promise would
                    bring, rather that our current path, as ordained and still, will naturally reach; be it through a
                    means or
                    the concurentend.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, I fret not over things I wish to have; nor do I even humour them, as I know in
                    principle, and in awareness of the tamber of the desire, that such things are not worth much. By
                    that
                    though, in all things appropriate, I may still try. Not fretlesslessly for grifted success, but
                    rather for
                    things which we have no recourse to not. The point, is that in the case for work, I may ask, as such
                    success
                    would be something were gratefull toward. But we already have much. And my starting point ought to
                    have
                    been, that what we have is not the primary matter, rather our use of things. It is like someone in
                    water who
                    was born to be in such, who seeks for more, of a quality kind let's say; but this is merely an
                    addition, an
                    arrangment or cirucmstnace; for your being is already one and with water. And swimming then is the
                    crucial
                    matter. And indeed, working at superstore would give us a bucket full; nor would walmart fail to
                    give me a
                    pale's worth. But our swimming will only come so far. As we will still be in this relatively small
                    pond, no
                    matter how much more it is filled up.

                    Our truest desire is akin to a meal, whereby the taste of the food was not only relevant, but our
                    company,
                    the lighting, even the breakfast early in the day. All things work this way for me, and as such, our
                    life
                    being swell, is but an aggregrate of all good things blending together to form a delivioushole.
                    <br>&emsp;I need only mention each one then, with some relations which would elevate our interest.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, Civ is coming out. And despite our recent flatness, so has our curiosity began to
                    peak;
                    all in part because our consumption of it through the fall had died down. When I see our scenario
                    though, I
                    see the possibility of moving, and the quandery of finding work from that. The game comes out a
                    month from
                    now, so our ability to anticiapate comes in conflcit with our apprhensiosn aod or preperation of our
                    time
                    ahead. This in many ways is the key reason I'd like to stay at home, and rightly. For Diablo is also
                    coming
                    out. Admittedly, prior to anything that would technically happen; but so is the good I see a little
                    capped
                    by not being able to seefurther.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I can say, that what I seek is stability. I want to imagine ourselves working
                    from home,
                    or training to be in IT, or running a creator buisness. I also wish to find some commradery in our
                    teamates,
                    showing up on a regular basis, feeling that there is somewhere for us to be. This sens of
                    contentment,
                    whether it is in line for future investement or pure content, so would it please me to bear some
                    union
                    between our intent and that of which our parents see. For they do not know that I agree to the
                    potential for
                    chidlren; and that seeing so, I only would care for one; or that I have such concerns for education.
                    That,
                    and my care for travel is not something I attest. For any feeling for it, or excitement, similar to
                    other
                    anticpations which furnish everything else, so do I see these cares for aborad to be but sparks from
                    our
                    seperated self; whereby nothing near or dear is close, nor something fair and hearty further seen.
                    And I
                    wish for them to hear this; nor do I want any pity, suggestion, our doubt as regards any esteem or
                    ability
                    to travel. "I wish not for their rose tainted appeals or support."
                    <br>&emsp;What I want overall is a place where I no longer see, but happily am. I will endure,
                    embrace,
                    steady and raise. But so would I care for somewhere that I saw progress and habitiation as our path,
                    rather
                    than dreams, reservation, justification or conquest, born from a spot of comfort and flow.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, the core of our desires is in being able enough to be and set, as to
                    properly
                    engrain and sprout in our reflective way. For only is that the way for truth and measure, moral and
                    ground.
                    We need no other. And indeed, our experiene of this, by the virtue of principle in our temporary
                    states,
                    speaks to me as something which holds the evident promise of growth; but also a contrary brace to
                    our
                    otherwise whims and discontent: of which comes by the nature of that temporary post. "Our principle
                    merely
                    brings the iteration of our place to a close, and makes what comes to be a upper portion of the
                    wave,
                    seemingly all there is: by which I act, reflect and be." Thereupon I grown, learn and beckon, as to
                    choose
                    where I'll further move to. Only, the crux of our adolescent lives, is in living so purely, albeit
                    with a
                    bulge, in that sheltered peak, that so is the lesson worth decidiing from not one which is laid for
                    the gain
                    of such peak, but the lands beneath us: where right livinglies.

                    recieve credits, nor is the schedule for them outlined. I would like to have more information
                    regarding the
                    certificate and prospect. Skills are one thing, but they merely allow you to perform; or indicate
                    your
                    potential via a portfolio, or the practicum. But the certificate then is the real stamp, and I am
                    curious if
                    everything else is novelling benefiting, while the certificate is a meagercredit.

                    So exercise is exercise, as is stretching. But food is always a source of discretion; as you may
                    care
                    little, or a lot, and the selection for your choices is never soclear.
                    <br>&emsp;I can say, in terms of stretching, I would like to further our roster. Our hips have
                    recieved good
                    work in the recent month, and our shoulders have had some nice treatment; but indeed our chest and
                    spine
                    need more work, along with our legs.
                    <br>&emsp;Regarding food then, I feel a little famoished. This cannot be overlooked as a reason not
                    to forgo
                    exercise; for even upon doing that once, I feel stronger. So the balance of our needs is such that
                    our
                    improvement in exercise will equate.
                    <br>&emsp;I would say then that food is so unclear, for its purpose is merely associative, in that
                    it
                    supports your activity. By that, our interest is to play some Diablo, watch some videos and Clone
                    Wars, edit
                    some music and our website, walk, stretch, and do some running and pushups. Doing the latter
                    definitely
                    brings me into a compressed state, initially at least. So having something for that, in both comfort
                    and
                    recovery is usefull.
                    <br>&emsp;It is suppose to be a bit warmer tomorrow and Sunday, and less of a downpoor; then it is
                    not
                    suppose to rain for a few days. I mean to do some more pushups, despite the risk of comrpession.
                    This
                    benefits most from a lack of firm activity. Getting out then is nice, and food motivates this.
                    Perhaps we
                    can go to Fresh Co (and if not Superstore) Sundany evening.
                    <br>&emsp;This leaves us with needs for today and tomorrow. Bulk wise, we have plenty of grain
                    --though we
                    do need to cook barley. "Our soup is quite salty, so prior to butter, and large amounts, just use it
                    as a
                    seasoner to your grain." We have no oranges or kale, so we'll get those. Nor are there bananas.
                    Bread wise
                    we have bagels for tonight, and some whole wheat bread. We can grab some E.muffins on Sunday.
                    Protein wise
                    we have little, thought Quinoa is fine. I reckon that tomrrow, if not Sunday afternoon, will hold
                    the
                    compressed effects (if and any) from tomorrows session. So some Tofu would be nice.
                    <br>&emsp;Our recent efforts have turned me to calcium pills; though their bulk content of other
                    viatmins
                    makes it quite difficult to process. The perill of not doing so is not present; though I am fully
                    aware that
                    we are not drinking soy any more. I am not sure I wish to do so on a consistent basis. Nor is almond
                    milk
                    pleasing, or accessible, as you must replensih twice per week. The vitamins are relatively cheap and
                    last
                    for long. Perhaps we could forgo all things unessential, and choose gummies for easier digestion.
                    <br>&emsp;As it stands, our midday has switched from smoothies to bananas, seeds and dried fruit.
                    This has
                    worked well, but the stretch by which were satiated seems shorter. Normally, we'd have a smoothie
                    and bu
                    full till dinner. Whereas now, were quite bare by the later afternoon. Exercise may have something
                    to do
                    with this, as our preferreed schedule would see some roughage and fruit had early in the day. "We
                    also have
                    several apples, which can serve our eveningventures."
                    <br>&emsp;All in all, Kale, oranges, a few bananas, 1 tofu and some dried fruit, will set us for the
                    days.
                    We'll get some dinner on Sunday, and treat ourself to the tofu; and we'll get more bread or
                    essentials then.
                    Our soup is full, and we can make Barley and lentils for ittoday

                    So I seek no child. Simply, I am already fine, pleased and happy. Our choices have not faciliated
                    deep
                    stability, nor the comfort and growth which all people seek. But our actions are quite good, and our
                    abscence of bad one's keeps mehappy.
                    <br>&emsp;Oppertunity wise, I am not inclined to derail and or abate our current happiness. Such a
                    sentiment
                    falls on the dearness to certain things. These things are in need of their own attention, as in the
                    actual
                    moves in a dance, and that of provision, as to smoothly satiate our needs. Taking further steps, be
                    it in
                    investment or employment, have some promise, and eligbility to be equitable to our dearer ways. But
                    I find
                    their worth to be somewhat novel, and based on the future, rather than the present --as we can
                    concieve of
                    as being. And, as such, I find that our resistance to not seeing such horizon is one where we are
                    simply
                    obliged to be more present and clear now: which is not an easy thing to: for you must think, be
                    honest, iron
                    out your divots and holes: and by that token, submitt to theirprescence.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, our unease at merely being happy, comes down to the steadyness by which we
                    consider
                    being so. For such remarks are in practice, beyond us, and at that, of a future which further dreams
                    compare. This is why we write, as we are trying to be honest, and reach out for the light near us,
                    and
                    simply remedy the shortness of warmth: whereby we then color our ends with the dreams were
                    experiencing,
                    near and now, as if we were pleased with our liberty, to be moral andmodern.

                    I might say, with the energy I have, that being ill-set amongst those close to me, is a prime
                    contributor to
                    our distress. As, to rich ends or likely trouble, if we can't even approach things with clarity in
                    mind,
                    then so can't we find harmony with them: to which we nerously approach. Indeed, others may rustle
                    your idea
                    of what lies ahead, or which actions you can take on approach. But the culprit is not in fact their
                    behaviour, but our shared discussion: wherein each of us agrees in what we see, and can at least
                    know what
                    aim someone has in mind (through their variedaction).

                    "Despite communicating what is possible, andpotential."
                    <br>&emsp;But, due to normal needs, and corresponding amends, so may we rest on approach to such by
                    the
                    actions we know we'll take: ones which we can also remark upon ourarrival.
                    <br>&emsp;Simply, the matter here is one of negativity, whereby we see a threat, in terms of some
                    arduous,
                    monotonous, chastising load. And by that, a derision and or flattening of our dear goods.
                    <br>&emsp;The rule of our act, is such, that of those burdens, we may lift ourselves above them,
                    molding our
                    grip, attitude and performance. Not only that, but we can let time and community soften trouble's

                    wherein you recieve another's hand, or trim the actual weight of the burden. Beyond that, you may
                    increase
                    your interest in such activity by furthering the worth of it; whereby you understand the neccessity
                    in it,
                    and of this count, solidify the aim of your life. Moreover, you may simply see what it offers in
                    terms of
                    good, bread and freedom. Nor can you run out of suitable comparisons or advice, 'wherein we see how
                    our
                    scenario is favorable to others, nor lacking reason and ends which our mentors ascribe.' At any
                    rate, you
                    may actually benefit from these means, be it in baser elements, or those of color and spring. And of

                    So we have our duty coming. All in all, if I were King, proposed, and with expressive fortune, than
                    the
                    manner of such oblige would not thwart me. And even if it was deemed to be somewhat negativie, so
                    would the
                    reason for it bear meagainst.
                    <br>&emsp;But, as it were, it feels like were doing this for an unknown reason. Despite this feeling
                    arbitrary and contrived, I can see that there is an ultiamteprinciple.
                    <br>&emsp;Yet, said course of action holds with it very little animation to such principle. All it
                    really
                    amounts to is our progeny, our leadership and or expression. I cannot see where these things lie
                    though. As,
                    our insight is such, that of our common course, where the paces are liberal and rich, so do we
                    naturally
                    proceed, and by thave, have a sort brim cheer as we approach whatever's ahead. Only, when duty
                    comes, or
                    friction at that, we tend to loose our sight, and beckon to the obscurity by which we are either a)
                    obliged
                    for such principle, or b) destined for such, for which said principle is attested to, and our duty a
                    stable
                    means for so.
                    <br>&emsp;Bringing this all in, we have our happiness, and of an abundant sort. And from this, is
                    where I
                    see. Though, all the likely born from the still present deeds upon us; only, by the times and our
                    sensibility, we simply had more room and means to be so inclined. Yet, the limits of that, and
                    pressures,
                    still brought me to be so principally inclined.

                    So dreams come because we are undoutdedely stressed. Nature is ever upon us. I don't see this as
                    some
                    seperation, as if wind upon rock was a dual matter. But I do see, that, by the whims of the whole,
                    or
                    however you'd state it, that so must we attend to our basic deed: breathe, eat, sleep, rest,
                    survive. These
                    all come about because we are inbued with pleasure and pain. Across the range of these, we tend to
                    predict
                    and anticiapate for the sake of.
                    <br>&emsp;As children we are not less filled with obligations than those of us older. The form is
                    different,
                    but we are still equally in thedomain.
                    <br>&emsp;I say this, for one may think, in privalage or congruency, that they may be absent of such
                    conditions, and by that, free to experience all that they seek. There is merrit to this, but the
                    sentiment
                    needs a strongerstatement.
                    <br>&emsp;Simply, as we grasp for breathe, so do we perk up at the sun's shine. This is akin to our
                    awareness of threats, or ease upon a coming relief. Happiness is merely this forrayed into an
                    positive
                    abundance. Whereby, those things which spark our less than begrieved minds, are seen, sought and
                    attended
                    to. "I can say that our past has dealt us a rich hand in these regards. But so do I sulk a little at
                    this
                    state of mind being disturbed. Besides the lapse of such goods, the blurr of our sight of them is

                    So I woke up a nearly 330 --and admittedly, it was a slight bit before that. I can't say exactly,
                    but I fell
                    asleep around 7, meaning we had a full sleep. For one, a full sleep, compared to 6 or 7 hours, seems
                    all the
                    difference between good and bad living. Moreover, achieving this ought be done so thorugh earlier
                    sleep,
                    rather than sleeping in later.
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, I would love to wake up at 5:00 on the regular. Today felt like it went by
                    blazing
                    fast; and despite that, we felt cool and collected, and sure as well. I'd say going to be around 8
                    seems the
                    best. At least, no more eating, or screen time. Just walk, stretch, read and rest. Perhaps we won't
                    be as
                    tired. But I'd still benefit from waking earlier, and letting our appropriate bedtime be sooner.
                    Last I
                    checked, it was noon oclock, and now were reaching 2. But its near time for dinner, and we have so
                    much room
                    to go. Our days in fact feel longer and all aroundbetter

                    One of the realities of living with other people, is that they are going to do things which are
                    either a)
                    annoying, or b) contemptible. Partciualarly, with family, this sense will be magnififed, as such
                    things will
                    feel worse coming from you, nor so easily communicated. "Things thusharbour."
                    <br>&emsp;But the relaity is that our discontent with such matters, no matter the degree, come from
                    an
                    unsteadyness in ourself. Namely, that we have no real grasp on things, and are thus unerved by
                    things which
                    press upon us; as we have no natural press, nor sturdy grounds forbracing.
                    <br>&emsp;I'll say then, that our life is such, that of a sort of flow, we are going into one of
                    stability.
                    It cannot be overlooked that this state will include work and self-provision. But it is also so
                    different
                    from every other moment of our life. The main difference being, that our conditions were self
                    imposed, via
                    our interests and creativity, and the normal arrangment with your family, and the encumbent, and
                    generally
                    seen, foresight of our future success and oblige. Our current moment is merely brining things to
                    light, so
                    that our stability is born from us, and thus held by our amends. Nor, compared to the scorn and
                    weariness of
                    dependance, we may rightly and fully address our life and ways. This is no poor matter, and as so,
                    we may
                    clearlyattend.
                    <br>&emsp;For starters, we are always conditioned. And our sense that something is wrong, stems from
                    the
                    fact that our place in such condition is either unappreciated, or immature. As all, in slavery or
                    kingship,
                    naturally instatiate themselves to their position; whereby the trouble of it becomes adapted to, as
                    do their
                    strenghts rise over the weight of the request; nor do the rewards stay flat, as your mere prescence
                    tends to
                    bring more reward, if not familiarity and the according satisfaction. Nor, in the things beyond this
                    post,
                    where our postive concerns are drawn, are we so blinded and or hampered to such sights, and by that,
                    witheld
                    to attend. "And there lies hope, to which this calm sea, in all its tides and ripples, elevates the
                    basiclevel."
                    <br>&emsp;In this way, I am grappling with the objects which my unadorned mind seeks; and whether
                    such
                    things ought guide me, and thus become our ends in sight. For such matters, in all the prescence,
                    tend to
                    linger infront us when we have stopped; but our sight of them prior was one that was at that point
                    ahead; as
                    in our fuller strides, we naturally saw the road ahead, and where our heart was taking us. Indeed,
                    these
                    moments held objects of mere sentiment, in that a future of sacrifice and contribution were gleemed.
                    Only,
                    now as our ordinary way has halted, or at least settled, into moments of indolence or rest, so are
                    we
                    without a clear horizon: in decleration or senitment.
                    <br>&emsp;My feeling remains though, that the latter notion is one that marks the proper form of
                    things. For
                    our remarks of the former bring with them a sort of grasping breathe, as the nature of our indolence
                    suggests. And so I heed these not, for the objects deemed are so, and in that esteemed, 'by our
                    halted
                    state'. And the according feeling that we ought, and pleasingly so, amend, is not so fair or valid,
                    in that
                    such ends are concieved and validated by our own lacking: rather than a relation born from solid
                    grounds,
                    and thus clear sight. "Were reaching in one, and merely open to the other. As if we are trying to
                    come back
                    to the world, whereby we strike a thin line; to which entry point holds the only insight to the
                    world we
                    see. While our other way, sees us already near and dear to the world, in all her grace and entirety.
                    And
                    happily, we see ourselves striding towards cleaningup."

                    I am a little to idle to say much more than the purest remark. Which is, I have no desire for
                    children. Nor
                    do I recognize much interest in me, besides a sentiment of dreams and or conjuration (as to
                    anticapte). I
                    will admitt that during I finer strides, which are not so constant as to be solid until a discrete
                    change,
                    that within the dips and tides of such finer periods (we'll say), so do I recognize there a heartier
                    view of
                    such ends. In all fairness, this sentiment only occurs as a sort of validation, and or assurance as
                    to
                    something ahead. The difference being in times of more hollow moments during our better days, and
                    the wholer
                    future I see, and what I see during our truly idle times: whereby all but the suns light gleams so
                    harsh
                    upon me, that regards for a child are the next best thing to planning on reaching themoon.
                    <br>&emsp;In any case, my solice here is one that permitts recogniton of that natural course. But it
                    is not
                    a course which I am thrilled to be on, or at any rate, meet. And although these recent days have
                    shown me
                    the fair exepectaion of such ends, and the good in sturdying our course for such, I still see that
                    most of
                    what I seek is not so ingrained to such acceptence, but rather the motions of art and leisure, and
                    by that,
                    the according dreams and futility.
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed, as those latter swellings have whithered off, so have we felt a little bare in our
                    purities. Which is to say, that amidst our purities, in their whole and hearty ways, there lies a
                    man
                    content with such, and by that, without much care or contention around him. Time has shown her way
                    though,
                    and brought me to a understandble rebuke, in that, for ends I seek -and the according fancy- or
                    those which
                    have some regard for what is likely, and if not tradiotnally (and as much common), that so ought I
                    be better
                    in my amends; for so much of our time is spent living privately, or at least enclosed. And for some
                    time
                    this served our aim of improvment. But as those years have worn off, and we are now at most
                    remembering the
                    good in being as we improved, so am I left with the honest remark that our inconstancy is born, by
                    choices
                    that have made us ill-equiped or fit for such being.
                    <br>&emsp;My point overall comes from this, in that, of children, or contribution, so do these lay
                    as
                    laudible points of that improved path. But as things, and our view of them, so are they gleamed from
                    the
                    stance of such being. And such a stance, in all honesty, sees with it a need to settle into our rich
                    and
                    gradual path. One of which, in all fairness, sees where we are lacking in terms of those natural
                    ends. For
                    however likely, we may have little sense or idea about how to approach them. That we'd reach them,
                    and
                    strive for them at that, is not something which needs change. But for such important deeds, as would
                    become
                    of such ends, so doth our potential occurence with them reveal the quality of our view and
                    understanding of
                    them.

                    For most my life I've been obsinate. The only time I was ever free was when I was running around,
                    playing
                    with myfriends.
                    <br>&emsp;I never knew many girls, and seldom would they run with us.
                    <br>&emsp;Our life was never an issue this way, as we were solid, tough, strong. Indeed, we often
                    got into
                    trouble. But welearned.
                    <br>&emsp;What I can remember though, is that upon our youthful age, life became somewhat tilted,
                    setting
                    onto a point which was not so much about satisfaction and joy, but comfort and fun. We were no
                    longer
                    running around, seeking the mere prescence of friends. But rather hanging out, and at that,
                    appearing
                    places. I never liked this.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, our shift into youth saw us ingratitated to such a flow of life. But in all
                    fairness,
                    it was still of an age where all the tits and tats were done at school. Indeed, we would stay around
                    after,
                    and there were the inklings of hanging out later than that. But for the most part, not much had
                    changed.
                    When we shifted to fully into youth though, it was clear that we were in line with such matters in
                    their
                    fullest expression.
                    <br>&emsp;In all honesty, the conduct of these ways was not so heavily attuned as my remarks may
                    suggest.
                    For the flair of things which I cared little for was centered around school, and not so much
                    afterwards.
                    That is, during recess for instance, there were kids who played soccer, or on the field at least,
                    and those
                    who stood near the school, in a huddle, full of girls and boys, puffing themselves up, chatting,
                    rumouring
                    around. I was so opposed to this. In comparison to the similar scenario the time prior, I was
                    naturally at
                    the heart of it. While in this circumstance --having switched schools-- we were near the outer ring.
                    And
                    sitting there, appearing present, was just stupidlyoff.
                    <br>&emsp;For whatever reason, my entire youth was spent orbiting this arrangment. Only, my care for
                    it was
                    critical, and full of timid scrutiny. The idea of being so prevalent was something which had me
                    blush, or at
                    least shy away from. "And like someone young and in love, but embarrassed by it, 'I equally said
                    such things
                    were stupid'."
                    <br>&emsp;In this way I isolated myself. For I did not change our path, and find other places to be,
                    or
                    people to be around. Or at any rate, as I have become in my current life, I did not finely amend to
                    myself,
                    and cultivate that. Which is to say, that in all the stupidity I saw around, I did not foster myself
                    in our
                    place outside of it, as to be a better version of myself in suchplace.
                    <br>&emsp;I must remark though, that despite our aversion to group sentiment and mentality, I did
                    have great
                    friends. I recalll one who I had never met prior to beginning our highschool year, and he and I
                    shared all
                    our classes, and time together. And beyond that, whether I naturally settled in with my classmates,
                    I always
                    had a good friend or two. And surely one of them was the best, and one who I spent much of my time
                    outside
                    of school with. For some reason the interests we had at that age, playing games, eating food and
                    staying up
                    late, was not something I sought to share with a bundle of people. Especially when I was older, but
                    so in
                    general, this sort of experience felt diluted; either in the enjoyment I would get, as expressing
                    myself
                    felt so crowded out; or, the intent I had, or care for the things at hand, lost their focus and
                    attention.
                    And overall, I just never enjoyed 'hanging out', in that we'd just bro around, through jabs at
                    eachother and
                    what not. I always preferred the actual activity, be it soccer, a hike, a game, or a film. And for
                    my whole
                    life I have either gone where I could do so to a solitary degree, or with a small amount of folk, or
                    mere
                    friend, who would share said activitiy withme.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, my life has been such, that circumstance has taken me away from what I know,
                    and
                    thus offered me only the easier task of mingling with groups of people; and not so much the longer
                    task of
                    making a dearer friend. Indeed, moving to Pitt Meadows did this; for depsite making good friends,
                    our choice
                    of highschool was detterred by our sentiment regarding the people I'd see myself going with. For
                    that, I
                    went somewhere other. And indeed, highschool felt even more pitched in its group mentality; beyond
                    the
                    little nooks of closer friends that is. But for whatever reason, our life was such, that of our view
                    and
                    course in life, so was it not inclined or appropriate to the norms around; and all the likely
                    because the
                    dreams and assurance we had, was built on finer cares and principles, rather than those of young
                    flirty men.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, our natural path was so, that based on the prolonged stay at school, we
                    naturally
                    incorporated ourselves into more people; and at that, invited interests by others. Early in our
                    years, this
                    process highlighted our immaturity and ways. For in grade 9, two girls showed interest in me, one
                    doing so
                    with near explicity. And I shrugged it off, feeling either nervous, embarrassed, or afraid. Simply,
                    my 'shy'
                    critique of things, in the depths of me we'll say, manifested in this rerpoach from my parents:
                    regarding
                    girls in particular. And so despite feeling fine to be invovled with someone at school, I just felt
                    so
                    averse to their invovlement; so much so, that in that explicit case, I said no. "I reckon, that as I
                    saw
                    much of the puffiness and confidence of people around, that so was our contrast to that something
                    which I
                    felt my parent's exasterbated." For one the key marks, is that our aversion to getting invovled with
                    someone
                    was that it would bring us into the sight of others. In this case, the girl was of a prominent sort.
                    And so
                    my sentiment was that if we got invovled, I would either a) become situated in the tits and tats of
                    all her
                    friends, or b) feel strange and awkward at holding myself back, 'while she otherwise explains my
                    oddities to
                    them: making exucese for my lack ofincorporation'.
                    <br>&emsp;In any case, this pace of life was brought to our crucial defeat. For life had whithered
                    my down a
                    little, in its wants and needs from me. So much so, that depsite our consistent lameness, we filled
                    out a
                    little, becoming more confident and 'socially tuned'. Yet, despite becoming naturally invovled with
                    other
                    people, I still did not have the bones to back it up. We found ourselves in a rich scenario, and a
                    disagreement arose; we mispoke, and became seperated from the group. Directly and not, our closer
                    relations,
                    'of those we sat nearest at the group table', left my side also --out of vehemence or happen chance.
                    And I
                    was left all alone, mad, depressed; but also obstinate, and in such a way that I appointed myself to
                    greater
                    actions and success. "A sort of 'screw you' attiude; of such a fuel at least, whereby we were
                    desperately
                    motivated to dowell."

                    So we've mentioend alpha 9 before, it being a colony out in the vastness of the Perseus. The planet
                    is
                    small, and without much vegetation. There is water, and by that, condensation; so that it rains, and
                    snows.
                    The tectonic activity has created mountains in the north, and great deserts in the south. Notably,
                    they have
                    massive purple hued crystals sticking out of them.
                    <br>&emsp;One of the reasons that the northwest was chosen, particularly in the gratient flat, is
                    that
                    aestheically and suitbaly, the place delights. In the north, runs a belt of mountains; pearing out
                    into the
                    western sea, too the easter edge, where mount cushing lies. "And beyond that, there appears flat
                    lands and
                    litte islands dotting the eastern sea." The flat runs down from these mountains, and runs many miles
                    south.
                    Whereby the land begins to dip, 'to which the in the distance the crystal desert lies'.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, the expidtion was banked on the richness of its inhabitants lives. Notably, so
                    that
                    they may stability and happily flourish, 'whereby their minds may be drawn and nourished, and
                    prompted with
                    a sense worth blinking back toearth'.
                    <br>&emsp;That being so, the gratient flat was such, that room was held for several hundred people.
                    Hoom was
                    built with state of the art technology, namely a reproductive line of machinery, whereby offspring
                    could be
                    produced. "Indeed the matter of children reamins an unclear matter." At any rate, the aim of the
                    colony was
                    to live well, and from there, have the lasting means to naturally and or unaturally persist; but all
                    the
                    likely exist initially in the greatest way.
                    <br>&emsp;As such, the flat was choosen because of its relation to the mountains, the western sea
                    and its
                    beach, the relative height compared to lower flats in the east, and that in the south. Simply, it
                    was an
                    unremarkably flat area of land, near the ocean, with views of the mountains, and enough space to
                    warrant
                    such delights. One of the initial initiaivtes was to cultivate the land. Namely, in that via the
                    prescence
                    of water, and the resource machinery on Hoom, the 'soil' naturally found in the ground, could be
                    made
                    harvestable. "Indeed, much of the settlements layout, as remarks beatuy, service and production, has
                    been
                    written in the policiesbound."
                    <br>&emsp;The heart of this story though, is that earth, in her mid century flair, is a little
                    riged.
                    Indeed, her modern style has grown out of the antiquate ways of the century prior. But still, she
                    beckons to
                    the past, in all the cracks and scarss which the annals have dealt. Her remarks are not seen as
                    detrimental
                    though, as in past expressions. Rather, she is merely stable, yet in a wobbly way. She still lacks a
                    purpose, an aim, some sense of how she'll forever be. Her subjects are of a fair sort, in that the
                    barbarity
                    and pundancy they embellished has but a lingering claim. But of those nearly modern, or variedly
                    natural, so
                    are they few and far between. Admittedly, all have the bones of this, and are not such of the
                    characters
                    millenai prior. But of something defined and elegant, so in the richness of peace and happiness,
                    they are
                    not. "They are but a bit more humble, a bit less clad, nor bigoted. Nor are they as mundane in their
                    freedoms, nor indulgrent. There just lacks something comparable to that which those primtiavely
                    espused; a
                    certainty, some principle, a soldity of living which is both felicituous and moral." And of those on
                    alpha
                    9, alike those sent further about, so are they all set to enliven such ends, 'and beam back
                    something which
                    worthy of earth'sbound'.

                    So I don't mean to degrade those I'm speaking for. For truly, my dissent of them is more a remark of
                    my
                    ill-fit for such ways; and of ways which are a mirror to certain virtues. "Being so shy, and
                    proclaiming
                    thing's I'm nervous about to be stupid, is no good remark ofme."
                    <br>&emsp;But I will say, that for all it's worth, I have never ceased this commision to the good,
                    and,
                    through our youth, an aversion to all things I esteemed not as so. Indeed I took this overboard; at
                    least my
                    weakness' became backers to my judgement. But still, I maintain that the crux of those ways, in
                    group
                    interest and broader tradition, is not becoming of what I seek, or of what I find comparable to the
                    experiences I find dear. "It is so, that our weakness', however present, were not so by pure
                    foundation, but
                    application: and our resolve was no pitched to be so prominent, due to the feeble ends Isaw."
                    <br>&emsp;My aim here is not to critique. My adolescent has held nothing but that. Instead, I would
                    simply
                    remark that of this way, be it with merrit or some sourced preference, that our commisery with it
                    was so,
                    that when we were stout and sound in it (those group and tradiotional ways), that I was fine,
                    excellent in
                    fact, and quite proper in our strides. But as life goes on, and our truer weakness and immatruity
                    come to
                    sway, we loose such prominence, and erode to the outer edges. "Where were simply looking in." It is
                    from
                    here that my life has been formed. For indeed, family trauma has bent me, nor had my actions been
                    rich in
                    sense or solidity; and as such, we were naturally unkept or settled as to be so prominent in those
                    taughty
                    ways.
                    <br>&emsp;Worth noting though, is that in all that time, and particularly as we were forced to grow
                    up,
                    there was never an ambition or sought return to such center. In it's entirety, this statement is not
                    true,
                    as there were motions that reflected such strides. But the intent was generally ill-founded. And an
                    further
                    sentiments of the sort were more akin to dreams and relief. "Whereby we had in fact become
                    ourselves, and
                    happily; but upon life's struggles and our trouble in being so, so did we conjure a destiny which
                    remarked
                    our greater selves, but to a glorious and generousdegree."

                    So to return to our story, we had broken off with some friends, eventually found new ones, and bad
                    habits at
                    that. And as highschool came to a close, were seeped in the boutinless pit of romance and purpose;
                    and our
                    poor habits had more fuel, as well were our parentsdispleased.
                    <br>&emsp;We reconciled this though and found a point of entry. We went to school in the following
                    winter
                    semester, to much acclaim and excitmenet. Only, I recall surely, that upon the mid-term exams, we
                    were left
                    feeling a little hollow and empty. Perhaps our poor efforts were not so rewarding, and thus our
                    engagmenet
                    was as solid as our effort was. But simply, without the novel motive of continuing to do well, the
                    lack of
                    purpose otherwise left me somewhat directionless and unconcerned about our school. The problem
                    though, was
                    that we were enrolled, and quite destined to find some place in life via this path. But of that I
                    saw not.
                    <br>&emsp;It was as if I gave way to my reserved and reckless self, but upon entering a better
                    realm, saw no
                    end in it, nor held any lasting enjoyment due to the applied nature of it. I firmly recall loving
                    the
                    initial half of the semester, as the lectures and post-secondary vibe just felt fun and meaningfull.
                    But the
                    second succcess was on the line, my immaturity and empty sight held me indismay.
                    <br>&emsp;In the year prior some habits had pitched me into a rugged hell. And during that time I
                    had
                    expeirenced a weird hypocondria, where I thought I was dying. "Really just a mixture of destiny and
                    dreams,
                    and that of lonely bareness: by which my heart faintly whimpered." In this later stretch of the
                    semester
                    though, I began to consider suicide. Not literally, in that I sought out a means to it. Rather, as I
                    reckon
                    all would compare, that there was merely a hope for death, 'or rather a cease of our current spot'.
                    I
                    rememeber going to sleep one night, wishing I wouldn't wake up. That was the nature of our intent.
                    Not so
                    much that we would, but that our care to live was gone, and if we were here no longer, how good
                    that'dbe.
                    <br>&emsp;Things did even out though, as final exams occured, followed by a visit to the states. Our
                    sentiments going in, and upon return, are not so clear, but I can say, as regards my habit, that I
                    had
                    become a little romantic about ceasing it, claiming 'todays the day, I quit'. And I recall
                    proclaiming that
                    right before I went on the trip; whereby I applied an almighty practice of binging on the soon to be
                    rot
                    substance, 'as if I would fill up my register, and satiate myself enough so that I could persist
                    withotu
                    doing it, indefinitely'. This worked as well as you'd imainge. For upon re-entry, I spent more time
                    acting
                    as I cared not to. And as the summer approach, I was sitting at my friends, in the monring in his
                    backyard,
                    and simply stated I was done. The whole time prior I had been exposed to such habits via certain
                    friends.
                    And in this time, those relations had become more distant; and thus my current plea was one that
                    held not
                    but me to say it. And my friend beside me was equally enamered, and pointedequally.
                    <br>&emsp;I wont speak for him, but for me, I had pulled myself out of the hollow hole that my
                    highschool
                    finale had set me in. There was nothing solid I'd reached, but remaining from our attempted efforts
                    was an
                    esteem towards myself. I would have to reflect to really understand the specifics; but I can say,
                    that this
                    initial sense that I had to prove myself was gone; nor was there this lack of what I enjoyed, or
                    cared about
                    in life, to make me feel like efforts of the prior sort were needed. "I no longer felt I was in a
                    hole.
                    Merely standing at the edge of a meadow." For whichever reason, I pointed my efforts for the sake of
                    that,
                    of what I can only describe as my interests and propiety. Simply doing what seemed good in itself,
                    and had
                    me 'being' better, rather than progressing towards some end.
                    <br>&emsp;On that day I quit, me and my friend went into his home. Similar to the bravado I had when
                    quiting
                    prior, 'when I had the flair and confidence that one similary has on new years, when they so
                    hopefully
                    resolve to change', that so was I equally elated and bent towards actions of an esteemed sort.
                    Simply, we
                    went on our computer and searched, 'ten healthiest foods'. Up came an article, showing Kale to have
                    1,000 vitamin K, mussels to have 10,000 B12, and a few more of the sort. Something struck us about
                    this, and initated a
                    sentiment that has remained
                    prevalent ever since. Being so inspired, we grabbed a bunch of flax, bananas and kale, and
                    smoothie'd it up. Upon
                    drinking it, we felt a little off about the flavor: but so did the point in our life changed. For
                    despite the taste
                    being a little rustic (and in retrospect, lacking of berries), we felt there was this strenght and
                    assurance which camce
                    from the quality of the food. We stood by it, reverred the good in it, and felt, akin to exercise,
                    or that even of the
                    esteemed career one should disipline themselves towards, that this item of ours was of pure worth,
                    no matter the taste.
                    "I might summarize this that we became ideal and disposed into taking our vitamins. And in that,
                    became quite literate
                    in the ways such things were espoused to benefit us. That they did is it's own matter. But of our
                    efforts, we could at
                    least prosper from our belief in them, and all the harmony which surroundedthat."

                    To properly view the world, you have to recognize that it is on a global scale. And thus conflict
                    and or
                    depravity will be exhibited within that total realm. The very fact that we have an economy, means
                    that the
                    pace of our life will move towards and draw from markets. And by that, as all conflict is based on
                    preservation, so will the shortcomings of that propell some to take what others have.
                    <br>&emsp;By this, I cannot say I know what is right and wrong. For I don't submitt to much more
                    than these
                    mere happenings. And of those purer causes, so is it but a drip of time to mend things out. And
                    indeed, all
                    negative conception can be blunted by this sense. For even in moments of severity, ought this be
                    shouldered
                    by calmer moments leading in, and simpler moments following. "And we ought not accept the fallacy of
                    thinking that this natural process of things is but a surrounding to an otherwise eradict event;
                    rather, it
                    too proceeds with common cause."
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, our core philosophy is that nothing occurs but through the annals of time.
                    And
                    generally all that occurs well, comes from inventions of sort; by which all can transition to use
                    such
                    advents, and propell the status of things to newer highs. But conflict and misfortune take time to
                    accrue,
                    and at that, are as equally swift in their progress.
                    <br>&emsp;From this, we are left with the odd remark, in that, if we are free enough to see the
                    annals
                    ahead, then ought we sink into such liberty and provide the products born from that. Or ought we
                    scower the
                    land around, and see whether or not there are those worse off than us. "Those who are sat un less
                    even
                    grounds us; as remarks perhaps the time, the culture, lineage even. For we may be so well off
                    because of our
                    particular circumstance; rather than that which is provided to all by the general times and ways:
                    some may
                    not have so readily caughtup."
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed, are furried threat is that of suggestion, and our vulernability from not being so
                    progressively applied. Indeed, I don't feel that those who provoke such feelings do so with the aim
                    of me
                    being a rebel. In fact, I think they'd like me to see the way things are, as to contribute towards a
                    lasting
                    change. Regardless of the strenght in what they say, and whether it illuminates issues as I'd see,
                    so are we
                    comparable in aim, to wit, we both care for the propserity of people; and by that token, the
                    development
                    pasttradition.
                    <br>&emsp;Our problem perhaps is that we don't live in a pasturized state, as to worry only about
                    what is
                    fair and relevant. Even if there were a war, and bombs were dropped, so wouldn't I know outside of a
                    superficual degree. This indeed is a dear admission. For much of my contention with those who prompt
                    such
                    thinness, do so only to the effect of our fear of something happening at all. And all too much of
                    our sense
                    bears the weight of reproaching from the belief that something will happen at all. "It would be
                    better to
                    accept that it can, but that, of reality, ought the bones of that be as strong as our conceptions
                    would
                    benefit." Indeed, this is quite tough, for reason says that little of which is true is actually
                    known. And
                    so in our less than applied ways, we are no less ignorant or short of principle. Nevertheless, upon
                    hearing
                    words of reason, or the babblings of this and other, so is our 'senility' within our particular
                    freedom
                    tampered with. And we are left with this underlying fear that things are not as we'd mind. "Perhaps
                    the
                    world is not so large, and our mature view is not representative."
                    <br>&emsp;Hereby our friction stands, to the effect, that of our balance between inputs which
                    unsettle, so
                    lies the counter of a sturdy understanding; wherein we are not simply with reproach, and humbly at
                    ease
                    outside of being provoked, but rather clear on things, and with a grip on them as our deeper
                    sentiments
                    reflect. To the effect that the complexion of our reproach is not merely a lauded haze, but a solid
                    iron of
                    which the obscurity of the world is known. "And not even the clearest debree of tradition or
                    pundancy could
                    penetratethat."
                    <br>&emsp;Where I stand then is in a sort of memory. As if, in a ruffled stated, we recalled how the
                    burning
                    grief present in our mind was in fact not laudible, nor comparable to our past experience of a deep
                    and
                    tranquil mind. By that, I'd state that the mind is but an electrical response, with a mere obscurity
                    to
                    distribution. By that, lies the contention of being: but to us, nothing special lies. At any rate,
                    even if
                    we lived in a war torn country, the service required of us would be one of sacrifice; to which our
                    triumph
                    was in courage, rather than overcoming defeat. "Herein lies the hunting grounds for chimera's of
                    pain of
                    monstrosity."
                    <br>&emsp;No matter, the fact remains that the world is relativley modern. And that, of those which
                    we deem
                    other, so are they so but in a novel way, rather than of the distinct sort in which our past
                    relations
                    reflected. We are all human; and despite the holes in our conduct, so is their a common union of
                    aims and
                    values; by which, in whole or parts, we share, support, and at the very least accept, the shared
                    goal of
                    love and prosperity. From this, I give much aceeptence to the fact that less a medely of nuclear
                    bombs are
                    dropped, that the world will persist. The effects of the climate, however progressed or developed,
                    will be
                    but novelly poor. "As our times are such, that the very matter of annihilation is a mark of us being
                    civilized enough as not to seek that, that so would our lasting process into a warming world, see a
                    resourcefull attempt to mitigate that: and at the very least treat its effects. To which we say, the
                    result
                    is but a degree of prominent perril." Robots sit 100 miles off of any reasonable regard; and surely,
                    find
                    themselves being seen with a even mind and confident eye.

                    So this may be a fools errand, as I have an interest in forming our selves, as not to be so
                    impressionable
                    during our rest or idle periods. I recognize though that during those moments, I will still be
                    subject to
                    said impressions. But my thought, is that by strengthening our views of things, as not to be so hazy
                    or
                    orbiting around, that their clearness and nearness will bear me a natural posture; and thus a normal
                    insolubility to sorbibsights.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, we are trying to learn of the world. Depth is one thing, but breadth is what I
                    seek.
                    Some things have a natural pairing with histroy, in population namely; or that of illness and death.
                    But the
                    reality is, that our efforts are pointed towards denominations and their resepctive proportions
                    within a
                    part of life. The rate of malaria in Africa, the suicide rate in Asia, the prevalance of aids in
                    Europe, or
                    the homicide rate in South America.
                    <br>&emsp;That being said, it is important to note the weight we put on certain strata. For the
                    earth as a
                    whole is in reality a set of continents, and they nations. These however, are each split into
                    regions,
                    states, terriotries/holds, cities and districts --Eastside of NewYork compared to the Bronx. For our
                    efforts, it makes sense to have a solid view of the larger pieces, and then specialzie in certain
                    smaller
                    parts. We may learn about the whole of Nigeria, the whole of China's southern region, the whole of
                    Ontario,
                    the whole of Miami, the whole of Compton. We will never know the whole of all these pieces. There is
                    just
                    too much. But we can find strenght at lower depth, comparable to what we have near the surface.
                    <br>&emsp;At that, I'd describe our broader efforts as one which balance between continents and
                    countries.
                    For the matters of Asia are one thing, but those of India and China seem most prevalent. In that
                    sense,
                    Canada, the US and Mexico are a fair western batch, as is Brazil, Argentina and Urugay perhaps;
                    along with
                    Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa another; and Britain, Germany and France as the big European three.

                    So it feels like we should be ourselves; but in that, be somewhat seperate, if not distinct, from
                    our mother
                    and father.
                    <br>&emsp;It would seem preferable that we'd all co-exist. But if there isn't a shared view of
                    things, or
                    taste for what not, then the seriousness of this may lead to distance yourself. For I will always be
                    near,
                    if not around. But our actual invovlement, if beyond family matters, is spent together, is up
                    forquestion.
                    <br>&emsp;For my parents view the news. And idneed, without our own sect of ingestion, we are left a
                    little
                    thwarted by the very prescence of this; as if said source is something soul and entire, 'as in the
                    governances of fables: to which the protaganist ignores'.
                    <br>&emsp;In the comparison of church, there are many, and of varied divisions and orders; kinds
                    even. By
                    seeing that our parents view one line of things, so are we less grieved by the impression of such
                    thing,
                    'for it is merely one of many means of impression'.
                    <br>&emsp;What I find though, is that I feel a little bare when we are so disposed to our view of
                    things; if
                    we are humouring this varied mix. But if I simply be, and not worry so much about our identity, then
                    the
                    prescence of the news becomes consuming. For it is not so that it is special in its impressions;
                    rather,
                    that by our cirucmstance, we are privy to it: for our parents watch it often through the day.
                    <br>&emsp;I will state for the record, that our animosity is akin to a disturbance of peace. A state
                    of
                    which may not rightly be so; but no so for we lack which the disturbanced is in the form of; but
                    rather our
                    somewhat private and or unoccupied means of peace. In that, our identity is such as to receive less
                    impression, as we are sold to another. But in this, we are less receptive to our family and fortune:
                    for
                    like impressions, we keep things out. And so I feel more confident, and longing, for a scenario
                    which is
                    faciliative to that: likely by our own means, rather than the generoisity of ourparents.
                    <br>&emsp;It may simply be so, that our parents are inclined to watch the news. They may have very
                    well been
                    more mdoern, and watched podcasts, or been more delierate, and watched nothing at all. "At least,
                    whatever
                    they did watch, they were aware of it, and noted assuch."
                    <br>&emsp;The trouble is that I cannot say anything. For it is essentially peverting our state in
                    the
                    family; nor, if we then moved out, or provided for ourself, would we so deeply care: or be privy to
                    such
                    disturbances.
                    <br>&emsp;The reality though, is we are not asked to contend with what they see or feel regarding
                    the news.
                    Nor do we have to humour their fascination, or respect for those invovled. Words of the kind have
                    never
                    comeup.
                    <br>&emsp;Where were left then, is in this comparable spot to one we've been in before; whereby we
                    sit, a
                    little uneased, but in a space which ought be alotgether full of it: for we are given all, and asked
                    for
                    not: yet still remain unfine, or at least susceptible to intrusion. Our little world is what's
                    provided. But
                    this get's tampered with from media and tv.
                    <br>&emsp;I guess my resovle ought be, as reflects our encouragment to learn what we are otherwise
                    in
                    defense of, as contrasts those impressions which we deny, what it is we ought to do, or can do and
                    would
                    like, with respect to what we know. Which is in all, to say, that perhaps ideally their would be a
                    different
                    form to our gradual approach, in that the strenghts and weaknesses of it would be natural. But in
                    this case,
                    even if the weaknesses exposed are akin to that which gets shown upon vile consumption, that so may
                    we
                    attest to the thing discovered. And considering the principle defect shown, or insight gained, so
                    may our
                    resolve be equally based. "In that, upon learning who we truly are, may we amend to something truly
                    worth
                    doing: and how we deliberaytleybe."

                    So I am not a solider, nor will I be one. I accept the conflict that others may find with those
                    around them;
                    but I am all too happy to accept any ones rule. Much aggression has occured due to self-defense. But
                    personally, there is nothing I hold dear which can be taken from me: as all good is already mine.
                    Indeed,
                    one may coherce me to do something. But nothing which goes against what I already do. "I am not
                    defending a
                    belief agasint another, as I have nonealready."
                    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the unclaimed land of inquiry. Around this lies the smoldering
                    flame of
                    legend: namely, that of other peoples view ofthings.
                    <br>&emsp;For there may be a war, and it may appear as if all are fixated on this. But there is, in
                    reality,
                    a grand assortment of people whos minds are somewhere else. Nor, is any event, so special when
                    compared to
                    the millions around. The world will simply moveon.
                    <br>&emsp;I cannot always see this though. Indeed, my aversion to particular sources is that they
                    flatten my
                    view of things, and make bank of knowledge squishy. But the truth, is that without the sensibility
                    which
                    remarks what I have known, then so will I become engrained to the fixated sense: where I then fear
                    and
                    believe, that of a conflict there is exclusively so; and of others views, so are they but nearer to
                    the soul
                    thing of importance.
                    <br>&emsp;My life then is odd. For the base of it comes down to our ignorance of tradition, and an
                    otherwise
                    state within a path uncompramised. From here, we've simply asked questions. Perhaps out of this
                    dynamic,
                    whereby we are left with nothing but which we have. And our family is perhaps so acceptably present,
                    that
                    there habits and views become enclosed around me, 'as that smoldering flame'. I never seem to escape
                    this.
                    In fact, those early days of self-embrace, and the cause of that, come from a similar process, in
                    that our
                    parents were not listened to: and so we found our other way. For having none felt hopeless and not.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I have come to grow, is in the constance of this state, even if I was smoldered; and
                    from
                    there, drawn to restless rebuke, or rot relief. But I carried on; in some ways addressing the
                    principle
                    nature of this way, whereby I curried myself as not to be so vulnerable. But I never found anything
                    else, in
                    realtionships, meaning or friends. And so, the lingering heart of our mom and dad was so, that our
                    shortcomings were immediately subject to their prescence. "One of which is moulded in sharp contrast
                    to
                    mine." Indeed, this state of constance has shown me, that of it polished shine, that this need not
                    be
                    sequestered, or imperfect. We may simply choose as to reflect the cheer in that way; and perhaps be
                    invested
                    and ordained enough, as not to notice the heat from those, who'd melt you when you've lost your
                    ownflame

                    So we have potential interviews coming up in a few weeks. If not, we have a more than likely
                    approach to a
                    march 1st move.
                    <br>&emsp;For now, our health is in turmoil, as our lack of pushups and pullups has had me in a soft
                    state;
                    but our efforts to improve this have been toforceufull.
                    <br>&emsp;I am more or less resolving to principle. Primarily, we are going to convert our attention
                    to
                    running, and use free range as a intermidary motion, and those pushups and accompanying exercises to
                    broaden
                    said running. Too much are we doing the latter without any foundatioanl respect: to which we become
                    gritteddown.
                    <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are morning, stabilitiy and rest. For that, there are practices and
                    commonstrides.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, we simply stand, fold, raise our arms over head, and potentially squat too. For
                    stability, we mix runners lunge and lifts; with slight variations of warrior, leg raise and or
                    bridge, quad
                    stretch, and more emphasis on upward dog and planks. Attached to this are actual stretches; for I
                    know too
                    few besides pigeon pose; and so adding that to our stability seems fair. Rest centers around your
                    shoulders
                    and hips. Though, besides brief stetches, our shoulders having nothing more than the suttle recovery
                    of our
                    spine: for which they sit more gently. We may hug, cross, or bend, but this feels more dynamic than
                    a merry
                    hip opener or twist. Still, it is crossing our legs or arms which remark rest, then rinsing it off
                    with
                    baser poses --prone or supine.

                    I can't speak to my life. And, fairly, I sit a little humble and unperturbed. This moment isn't a
                    great one;
                    but it is fine being so. For the days ahead are so stout and true, that in principle, theres not
                    much for me
                    tosay.
                    <br>&emsp;We are so free to be hired, that I cannot even care. We will work some amount, but the
                    reason for
                    it is good, as is there a moderate amount of joy, and otherwise benefit from doingso.
                    <br>&emsp;As a spring, we are thus stable. And via our developed approach, may we see the future,
                    and
                    gradually reach it. Or, if we are more content and propped to be, or see things differently, then so
                    may we
                    reflect, and via letters, share. "Our view of children is mine. And is much more intended for you?
                    May see
                    all things beyond that, as regards our cares, and whatsmoral."

                    So I have some feelings that are causing me grief. There's no problem, but my view of certain things
                    feel
                    unknown, and so I thought by merely sharing this, my aprpehension wouldcease.
                    <br>&emsp;So I am writing this, not becuase there's some problem to be solved or thing to be changed
                    Rather,
                    I just have some feelings, and hiding them is causing me to feel contentious, but not warrentedly.
                    So I
                    thought that sharing them would remedythis.
                    <br>&emsp;First, I do not like the news. It does not speak to me, nor does it reflect how I see the
                    world,
                    and by that, how I desire and fear things. I simply don't identify with it. It is not a resource
                    which I
                    admire, or find pleasure engaging with. I've felt this way for a long time, and it is the key
                    example of a
                    feeling which makes something into a problem, only because it is unheard. Nothing need change. I
                    just wanted
                    you toknow.
                    <br>&emsp;///Ever since I moved up to Kamloops, and to this day, I have felt off because of this, as
                    every
                    morning and night, the news is on one of our tvs. To me, my ignorance is not measuredd by whether I
                    watch
                    the news or not. The world is larger and more mundane than anything it provokes. Which is indeed my
                    biggest
                    grievence with it, that it provokes me, to feel sympathy and frustration. I find no pleasure in
                    this, and in
                    my personal time, I avoid such things --in terms of my time and youtube etc.//// I am not asking
                    anything to
                    change. But as I said, not sharing my feeling leads to unfair judgement and resentment, and I'd
                    rather it be
                    known how I feel, then be full of irritation and scorn. I simply don't care forit.
                    <br>&emsp;Secondly, is the course of my life. To squash this pretense that 'my oddities are an
                    inhibitor to
                    things', I would say, conversely, that my lack of friends, career and romance are not so because
                    I've made
                    myself uneligble. It's simply because of the choices I made. Prior to leaving Vancouver, I was well
                    sat at
                    work, in friends and potential romance. I don't expect that this cannot return. In term's of work, I
                    see the
                    promise (as mom suggested) in getting a certifacte in IT. I cannot say this is my prferred job
                    though, as it
                    would surely be from home, and right now, I care more to be around people, and work on my feet. It
                    is a good
                    option, and there are much more like it, but it is not in my current sights. It is something I can
                    progress
                    towards, and develop my baser means of income, but when I think of what I'd really like to do, for
                    interests
                    sake, I'd like to make a TikTok channel, making little quotes and phrases made from my writing. It
                    has to be
                    a buisness though, as the consistency required cannot be approached casually, nor
                    withoutpreperation.
                    <br>&emsp;Neither of these mean that the other can't be pursued, but they'll each find theirtime.
                    <br>&emsp;I feel drawn to do this, but I'm being realistic about how much it takes, and what I'm
                    willing to
                    do right now. I don't see this interfering with more standard work, but one is but a development
                    past
                    working basic labor, while the other is about something I'd truly care for. Each will find
                    theirtime.
                    <br>&emsp;Thirdly, is chidlren. Say what you will of my life, where it's lacking, where it could be,
                    but I
                    contend, that the only thing I have to anwser to, in terms of some requirment in life ahead, is
                    children. I
                    can say, that naturally, I'll have one. I say this happily, and with understanding of what it needs.
                    Having
                    given this some thought prior, I can say that I'd only want 1. That, and I see myself doing so when
                    I am
                    ready to make it my primary happiness and responsability. Currently, theres an abudnacne of things I
                    otherwise care for, and am driven towards. So beyond my means to having a kid, I don't have much
                    desire for
                    one, now at least. And as for a relationship which would precede this, I have no fear or worry about
                    that.
                    My oddities, upon thought, are not any concenr, or something I can't adjust.
                    <br>&emsp;All in all, my only cares are to write, read and study, play games, watch youtube, be
                    healthy and
                    relish the outdoors. This is satisfactory on my own; and I can surely invovle more people in this.
                    Even if
                    there are none who I connect with on said basis, there are still other things I can do to be more
                    social, or
                    balance out my life elsewhere. These cares of mine feed off my ability to engage with them, which is
                    the
                    reason I care about being healthy: as the more I am, the more I can thrown myself in. And the moral
                    of my
                    life has been, that these things need not be sacrificed in order to pursue/have other things. You
                    merely add
                    tothem.
                    <br>&emsp;Those are my feelings, such is my way. If I can live accordinfly, than I am happy to be
                    home, and
                    benefit byit.
                    <br>&emsp;--to even out the rest of my life.
                    <br>&emsp;These are my dearest cares. When I am unhealthy and flattened by junk, they feel far away.
                    I ought
                    not be so frugal for the sake of these, at the expense of friends and all other things. But
                    considering that
                    those can be fit into my life, so am I unapolegtic for being as good as my happiness from those
                    other things
                    can beenfit from.

                    So I have some feelings that are causing me grief. There's no problem, or thing needing to change,
                    but my
                    view of certain things feels unknown, and thus I feel hidden and chained. I thought by sharing this,
                    my
                    apprehension wouldcease.
                    <br>&emsp;First, I do not like the news. It does not speak to me, nor does it reflect how I see the
                    world,
                    and by that, how I desire and fear things. I simply don't identify with it. It is not a resource
                    which I
                    admire, or find pleasure engaging with. I've felt this way for a long time, and it is the key
                    example of a
                    feeling which makes something into a problem, only because it is unheard. Nothing need change. I
                    just wanted
                    you toknow.
                    <br>&emsp;Secondly, is the course of my life. To squash this pretense that 'my oddities are an
                    inhibitor to
                    things', I would say, conversely, that my lack of friends, career and romance are not so because
                    I've made
                    myself ineligible. It's simply because of the choices I've made. Prior to leaving Vancouver, I was
                    well set
                    at work, in friends and potential romance. I don't expect that this cannot return. In term's of
                    work, I see
                    the promise (as mom suggested) in getting a certificate in IT. I cannot say this is my preferred job
                    though,
                    as it would surely be from home, and right now, I care more to be around people, and work on my
                    feet. It is
                    a good option, and there are much more like it, but it is not in my current sights. It is something
                    I can
                    progress towards, and develop my baser means of income, but when I think of what I'd really like to
                    do, for
                    interests sake, I'd like to make a TikTok channel, making little quotes and phrases made from my
                    writing.
                    Despite my interest, it has to be a business, in approach at least, as the consistency required
                    cannot be
                    approached casually, nor without preparation. Neither of these mean that the other can't be pursued,
                    but
                    they'll each find theirtime.
                    <br>&emsp;Thirdly, is children. Say what you will of my life, where it's lacking, where it could be,
                    but I
                    contend, that the only thing I have to answer to, in terms of some requirement in life ahead, is
                    children. I
                    can say, that naturally, I'll have one. I say this happily, and with understanding of what it needs.
                    Having
                    given this some thought prior, I can say that I'd only want 1. That, and I see myself doing so when
                    I am
                    ready to make it my primary happiness and responsibility. Currently, there's an abundance of things
                    I
                    otherwise care for, and am driven towards. So beyond my means to having a kid, I don't have much
                    desire for
                    one, now at least. And as for a relationship which would precede this, I have no fear or worry about
                    that.
                    My oddities, upon thought, are not any concern, or something I can't adjust.
                    <br>&emsp;All in all, my only cares are to write, read and study, play games, watch YouTube, be
                    healthy and
                    relish the outdoors. This is satisfactory on my own; and I can surely involve more people. Even if
                    there are
                    none who I connect with on said basis, there are still other things I can do to be more social, or
                    balance
                    out my life elsewhere. These cares of mine feed off my ability to engage with them, which is the
                    reason I
                    care about being healthy: as the more I am, the more I can throw myself in. And the moral of my life
                    has
                    been, that these things need not be sacrificed in order to pursue/have other things. You merelyadd.
                    <br>&emsp;Those are my feelings, such is my way. If I can live accordingly, then I am happy to be
                    home, and
                    benefit byit.
